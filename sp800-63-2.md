**Abstract**

This recommendation provides technical guidelines for Federal agencies
implementing electronic authentication and is not intended to constrain
the development or use of standards outside of this purpose. The
recommendation covers remote authentication of users (such as employees,
contractors, or private individuals) interacting with government IT
systems over open networks. It defines technical requirements for each
of four levels of assurance in the areas of identity proofing,
registration, tokens, management processes, authentication protocols and
related assertions. This publication supersedes NIST SP 800-63-1.

**Executive Summary**

Electronic authentication (e-authentication) is the process of
establishing confidence in user identities electronically presented to
an information system. E-authentication presents a technical challenge
when this process involves the remote authentication of individual
people over an open network, for the purpose of electronic government
and commerce. The guidelines in this document assume the authentication
and transaction take place across an open network such as the Internet.
In cases where the authentication and transaction take place over a
controlled network, agencies may take these security controls into
account as part of their risk assessment.

This recommendation provides technical guidelines to agencies to allow
an individual to remotely authenticate his or her identity to a Federal
IT system. This document may inform but does not restrict or constrain
the development or use of standards for application outside of the
Federal government, such as e-commerce transactions. These guidelines
address only traditional, widely implemented methods for remote
authentication based on secrets. With these methods, the individual to
be authenticated proves that he or she knows or possesses some secret
information.

Current government systems do not separate functions related to identity
proofing in registration from credential issuance. In some applications,
credentials (used in authentication) and attribute information
(established through identity proofing) could be provided by different
parties. While a simpler model is used in this document, it does not
preclude agencies from separating these functions.

These technical guidelines supplement OMB guidance, *E-Authentication
Guidance for Federal Agencies* \[[OMB M-04-04](#OMB_0404)\] and
supersede NIST SP 800-63-1. OMB M-04-04 defines four levels of
assurance, Levels 1 to 4, in terms of the consequences of authentication
errors and misuse of credentials. Level 1 is the lowest assurance level,
and Level 4 is the highest. The OMB guidance defines the required level
of authentication assurance in terms of the likely consequences of an
authentication error. As the consequences of an authentication error
become more serious, the required level of assurance increases. The OMB
guidance provides agencies with the criteria for determining the level
of e-authentication assurance required for specific applications and
transactions, based on the risks and their likelihood of occurrence of
each application or transaction.

OMB guidance outlines a 5-step process by which agencies should meet
their e-authentication assurance requirements:

1.  Conduct a risk assessment of the government system.

2.  Map identified risks to the appropriate assurance level.

3.  Select technology based on e-authentication technical guidance.

4.  Validate that the implemented system has met the required
    assurance level.

5.  Periodically reassess the information system to determine technology
    refresh requirements.

This document provides guidelines for implementing the third step of the
above process. After completing a risk assessment and mapping the
identified risks to the required assurance level, agencies can select
appropriate technology that, at a minimum, meets the technical
requirements for the required level of assurance. In particular, the
document states specific technical requirements for each of the four
levels of assurance in the following areas:

-   Identity proofing and registration of Applicants (covered in Section
    5),

-   Tokens (typically a cryptographic key or password) for
    authentication (covered in Section 6),

-   Token and credential management mechanisms used to establish and
    maintain token and credential information (covered in Section 7),

<!-- -->

-   Protocols used to support the authentication mechanism between the
    Claimant and the Verifier (covered in Section 8),

-   Assertion mechanisms used to communicate the results of a remote
    authentication if these results are sent to other parties (covered
    in Section 9).

A summary of the technical requirements for each of the four levels is
provided below.

**Level 1** - Although there is no identity proofing requirement at this
level, the authentication mechanism provides some assurance that the
same Claimant who participated in previous transactions is accessing the
protected transaction or data. It allows a wide range of available
authentication technologies to be employed and permits the use of any of
the token methods of Levels 2, 3, or 4. Successful authentication
requires that the Claimant prove through a secure authentication
protocol that he or she possesses and controls the token.

Plaintext passwords or secrets are not transmitted across a network at
Level 1. However this level does not require cryptographic methods that
block offline attacks by eavesdroppers. For example, simple password
challenge-response protocols are allowed. In many cases an eavesdropper,
having intercepted such a protocol exchange, will be able to find the
password with a straightforward dictionary attack.

At Level 1, long-term shared authentication secrets may be revealed to
Verifiers. At Level 1, assertions and assertion references require
protection from manufacture/modification and reuse attacks.

**Level 2** – Level 2 provides single factor remote network
authentication. At Level 2, identity proofing requirements are
introduced, requiring presentation of identifying materials or
information. A wide range of available authentication technologies can
be employed at Level 2. For single factor authentication, Memorized
Secret Tokens, Pre-Registered Knowledge Tokens, Look-up Secret Tokens,
Out of Band Tokens, and Single Factor One-Time Password Devices are
allowed at Level 2. Level 2 also permits any of the token methods of
Levels 3 or 4. Successful authentication requires that the Claimant
prove through a secure authentication protocol that he or she controls
the token. Online guessing, replay, session hijacking, and eavesdropping
attacks are resisted. Protocols are also required to be at least weakly
resistant to man-in-the middle attacks as defined in Section 8.2.2.

Long-term shared authentication secrets, if used, are never revealed to
any other party except Verifiers operated by the Credential Service
Provider (CSP); however, session (temporary) shared secrets may be
provided to independent Verifiers by the CSP. In addition to Level 1
requirements, assertions are resistant to disclosure, redirection,
capture and substitution attacks. Approved cryptographic techniques are
required for all assertion protocols used at Level 2 and above.

**Level 3** – Level 3 provides multi-factor remote network
authentication. At least two authentication factors are required. At
this level, identity proofing procedures require verification of
identifying materials and information. Level 3 authentication is based
on proof of possession of the allowed types of tokens through a
cryptographic protocol. Multi-factor Software Cryptographic Tokens are
allowed at Level 3. Level 3 also permits any of the token methods of
Level 4. Level 3 authentication requires cryptographic strength
mechanisms that protect the primary authentication token against
compromise by the protocol threats for all threats at Level 2 as well as
verifier impersonation attacks. Various types of tokens may be used as
described in Section 6.

Authentication requires that the Claimant prove, through a secure
authentication protocol, that he or she controls the token. The Claimant
unlocks the token with a password or biometric, or uses a secure
multi-token authentication protocol to establish two-factor
authentication (through proof of possession of a physical or software
token in combination with some memorized secret knowledge). Long-term
shared authentication secrets, if used, are never revealed to any party
except the Claimant and Verifiers operated directly by the CSP; however,
session (temporary) shared secrets may be provided to independent
Verifiers by the CSP. In addition to Level 2 requirements, assertions
are protected against repudiation by the Verifier.

**Level 4** – Level 4 is intended to provide the highest practical
remote network authentication assurance. Level 4 authentication is based
on proof of possession of a key through a cryptographic protocol. At
this level, in-person identity proofing is required. Level 4 is similar
to Level 3 except that only “hard” cryptographic tokens are allowed. The
token is required to be a hardware cryptographic module validated at
Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 Level 2 or higher
overall with at least FIPS 140-2 Level 3 physical security. Level 4
token requirements can be met by using the PIV authentication key of a
FIPS 201 compliant Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Card.

Level 4 requires strong cryptographic authentication of all
communicating parties and all sensitive data transfers between the
parties. Either public key or symmetric key technology may be used.
Authentication requires that the Claimant prove through a secure
authentication protocol that he or she controls the token. All protocol
threats at Level 3 are required to be prevented at Level 4. Protocols
shall also be strongly resistant to man-in-the-middle attacks. Long-term
shared authentication secrets, if used, are never revealed to any party
except the Claimant and Verifiers operated directly by the CSP; however,
session (temporary) shared secrets may be provided to independent
Verifiers by the CSP. Approved cryptographic techniques are used for all
operations. All sensitive data transfers are cryptographically
authenticated using keys bound to the authentication process.

At Level 4, “bearer” assertions (as defined in Section 9) are not used
to establish the identity of the Claimant to the Relying Party (RP).
“Holder-of-key” assertions (as defined in Section 9) may be used,
provided that the assertion contains a reference to a key that is
possessed by the Subscriber and is cryptographically linked to the Level
4 token used to authenticate to the Verifier. The RP should maintain
records of the assertions it receives, to support detection of a
compromised verifier impersonating the subscriber.

==================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Electronic authentication (e-authentication) is the process of
establishing confidence in user identities electronically presented to
an information system. E-authentication presents a technical challenge
when this process involves the remote authentication of individual
people over a network. This recommendation provides technical guidelines
to agencies to allow an individual person to remotely authenticate
his/her identity to a Federal Information Technology (IT) system. This
recommendation also provides guidelines for Registration Authorities
(RAs), Verifiers, Relying Parties (RPs) and Credential Service Providers
(CSPs).

Current government systems do not separate the functions of
authentication and attribute providers. In some applications, these
functions are provided by different parties. While a combined
authentication and attribute provider model is used in this document, it
does not preclude agencies from separating these functions.

These technical guidelines supplement OMB guidance, *E-Authentication
Guidance for Federal Agencies* \[[OMB M-04-04](#OMB_0404)\] and
supersede NIST SP 800-63-1. OMB M-04-04 defines four levels of
assurance, Levels 1 to 4, in terms of the consequences of authentication
errors and misuse of credentials. Level 1 is the lowest assurance level
and Level 4 is the highest. The guidance defines the required level of
authentication assurance in terms of the likely consequences of an
authentication error. As the consequences of an authentication error
become more serious, the required level of assurance increases. The OMB
guidance provides agencies with criteria for determining the level of
e-authentication assurance required for specific electronic transactions
and systems, based on the risks and their likelihood of occurrence.

OMB guidance outlines a 5 step process by which agencies should meet
their e-authentication assurance requirements:

1.  *Conduct a risk assessment of the government system* – No specific
    risk assessment methodology is prescribed for this purpose;
    however, the e-RA tool[^1] at &lt;<http://www.idmanagement.gov/>&gt;
    is an example of a suitable tool and methodology, while NIST Special
    Publication (SP) 800-30 \[[SP 800-30](#SP800_30)\] offers a general
    process for Risk Assessment and Risk Mitigation.

2.  *Map identified risks to the appropriate assurance level* – Section
    2.2 of OMB M-04-04 provides the guidance necessary for agencies to
    perform this mapping.

3.  *Select technology based on e-authentication technical guidance* –
    After the appropriate assurance level has been determined, OMB
    guidance states that agencies should select technologies that meet
    the corresponding technical requirements, as specified by
    this document. Some agencies may possess existing
    e-authentication technology. Agencies should verify that any
    existing technology meets the requirements specified in
    this document.

4.  *Validate that the implemented system has met the required assurance
    level* – As some implementations may create or compound particular
    risks, agencies should conduct a final validation to confirm that
    the system achieves the required assurance level for the
    user-to-agency process. NIST SP 800-53A \[[SP 800-53A](#SP800_53A)\]
    provides guidelines for the assessment of the implemented system
    during the validation process. Validation should be performed as
    part of a security authorization process as described in NIST SP
    800-37, Revision 1 \[[SP 800-37](#SP800_37)\].

5.  *Periodically reassess the information system to determine
    technology refresh requirements* – The agency shall periodically
    reassess the information system to ensure that the identity
    authentication requirements continue to be satisfied. NIST SP
    800-37, Revision 1 \[[SP 800-37](#SP800_37)\] provides guidelines on
    the frequency, depth and breadth of periodic reassessments. As with
    the initial validation process, agencies should follow the
    assessment guidelines specified in SP 800-53A \[[SP
    800-53A](#SP800_53A)\] for conducting the security assessment.

This document provides guidelines for implementing the third step of the
above process. In particular, this document states specific technical
requirements for each of the four levels of assurance in the following
areas:

-   Registration and identity proofing of Applicants (covered in Section
    5);

<!-- -->

-   Tokens (typically a cryptographic key or password) for
    authentication (covered in Section 6);

-   Token and credential management mechanisms used to establish and
    maintain token and credential information (covered in Section 7);

<!-- -->

-   Protocols used to support the authentication mechanism between the
    Claimant and the Verifier (covered in Section 8);

-   Assertion mechanisms used to communicate the results of a remote
    authentication, if these results are sent to other parties (covered
    in Section 9).

The overall authentication assurance level is determined by the lowest
assurance level achieved in any of the areas listed above.

Agencies may adjust the level of assurance using additional risk
mitigation measures. Easing credential assurance level requirements may
increase the size of the enabled customer pool, but agencies shall
ensure that this does not corrupt the system’s choice of the appropriate
assurance level. Alternatively, agencies may consider partitioning the
functionality of an e-authentication enabled application to allow less
sensitive functions to be available at a lower level of authentication
and attribute assurance, while more sensitive functions are available
only at a higher level of assurance.

These technical guidelines cover remote electronic authentication of
human users to IT systems over a network. They do not address the
authentication of a person who is physically present, for example, for
access to buildings, although some credentials and tokens that are used
remotely may also be used for local authentication. These technical
guidelines establish requirements that Federal IT systems and service
providers participating in authentication protocols be authenticated to
Subscribers. However, these guidelines do not specifically address
machine-to-machine (such as router-to-router) authentication, or
establish specific requirements for issuing authentication credentials
and tokens to machines and servers when they are used in
e-authentication protocols with people.

The paradigm of this document is that individuals are enrolled and
undergo a registration process in which their identity is bound to a
token. Thereafter, the individuals are remotely authenticated to systems
and applications over a network, using the token in an authentication
protocol. The authentication protocol allows an individual to
demonstrate to a Verifier that he or she has possession and control of
the token[^2], in a manner that protects the token secret from
compromise by different kinds of attacks. Higher authentication
assurance levels require use of stronger tokens, better protection of
the token and related secrets from attacks, and stronger registration
procedures.

This document focuses on tokens that are difficult to forge because they
contain some type of secret information that is not available to
unauthorized parties and that is preferably not used in unrelated
contexts. Certain authentication technologies, particularly biometrics
and knowledge based authentication, use information that is private
rather than secret. While they are discussed to a limited degree, they
are largely avoided because their security is often weak or difficult to
quantify[^3], especially in the remote situations that are the primary
scope of this document.

Knowledge based authentication achieves authentication by testing the
personal knowledge of the individual against information obtained from
public databases. As this information is considered private but not
actually secret, confidence in the identity of an individual can be hard
to achieve. In addition, the complexity and interdependencies of
knowledge based authentication systems are difficult to quantify.
However, knowledge based authentication techniques are included as part
of registration in this document. In addition, pre-registered knowledge
techniques are accepted as an alternative to passwords at lower levels
of assurance.

Biometric characteristics do not constitute secrets suitable for use in
the conventional remote authentication protocols addressed in this
document either. In the local authentication case, where the Claimant is
observed by an attendant and uses a capture device controlled by the
Verifier, authentication does not require that biometrics be kept
secret. This document supports the use of biometrics to “unlock”
conventional authentication tokens, to prevent repudiation of
registration, and to verify that the same individual participates in all
phases of the registration process.

This document identifies minimum technical requirements for remotely
authenticating identity. Agencies may determine based on their risk
analysis that additional measures are appropriate in certain contexts.
In particular, privacy requirements and legal risks may lead agencies to
determine that additional authentication measures or other process
safeguards are appropriate. When developing e-authentication processes
and systems, agencies should consult *OMB Guidance for Implementing the
Privacy Provisions of the E-Government Act of 2002* \[[OMB
M-03-22](#_General_References)\]. See the *Guide to Federal Agencies on
Implementing Electronic Processes* \[[DOJ 2000](#DOJ2000)\] for
additional information on legal risks, especially those that are related
to the need to satisfy legal standards of proof and prevent repudiation,
as well as *Use of Electronic Signatures in Federal Organization
Transactions* \[[GSA ESIG](#GSA_ESIG)\].

Additionally, Federal agencies implementing these guidelines should
adhere to the requirements of Title III of the E-Government Act,
entitled the *Federal Information Security Management Act*
\[[FISMA](#FISMA)\], and the related NIST standards and guidelines.
FISMA directs Federal agencies to develop, document, and implement
agency-wide programs to provide information security for the information
and information systems that support the operations and assets of the
agency. This includes the security authorization of IT systems that
support e-authentication. It is recommended that non-Federal entities
implementing these guidelines follow equivalent standards of security
management, certification and accreditation to ensure the secure
operations of their e-authentication systems.

NIST SP 800-63-1 updated NIST SP 800-63 to reflect current (token)
technologies and restructured to provide a better understanding of the
e-authentication architectural model used here. Additional (minimum)
technical requirements were specified for the CSP, protocols utilized to
transport authentication information, and assertions if implemented
within the e-authentication model. Other changes to NIST SP 800-63
included:

-   Recognition of more types of tokens, including pre-registered
    > knowledge token, look-up secret token, out-of-band token, as well
    > as some terminology changes for more conventional token types;

-   Detailed requirements for assertion protocols and Kerberos;

-   A new section on token and credential management;

-   Simplification of guidelines for password entropy and throttling;

-   Emphasis that the document is aimed at Federal IT systems;

-   Recognition of different models, including a broader
    > e-authentication model (in contrast to the simpler model common
    > among Federal IT systems shown in Figure 1) and an additional
    > assertion model, the Proxy Model, presented in Figure 6;

-   Clarification of differences between Levels 3 and 4 in Table 12; and

-   New guidelines that permit leveraging existing credentials to issue
    > derived credentials.

The subsequent sections of NIST SP 800-63-1 presented a series of
recommendations for the secure implementation of RAs, CSPs, Verifiers,
and RPs. It should be noted that secure implementation of any one of
these can only provide the desired level of assurance if the others are
also implemented securely. Therefore, the following assumptions were
made in NIST SP 800-63-1:

-   RAs, CSPs, and Verifiers are trusted entities. Agencies implementing
    any of the above trusted entities have some assurance that all other
    trusted entities with which the agency interacts are also
    implemented appropriately for the desired security level.

-   The RP is not considered a trusted entity. However, in some
    authentication systems the Verifier maintains a relationship with
    the RP to facilitate secure communications and may employ security
    controls which only attain their full value when the RP
    acts responsibly. The Subscriber also trusts the RP to properly
    perform the requested service and to follow all relevant
    privacy policy.

-   It is assumed that there exists a process of certification through
    which agencies can obtain the above assurance for trusted entities
    which they do not implement themselves.

-   A trusted entity is considered to be implemented appropriately if it
    complies with the recommendations in this document and does not
    behave maliciously.

-   While it is generally assumed that trusted entities will not behave
    maliciously, this document does contain some recommendations to
    reduce and isolate any damage done by a malicious or negligent
    trusted entity.

NIST SP 800-63-2 is a limited update of Special Publication 800-63-1 and
substantive changes are made only in section 5. *Registration and
Issuance Processes*. The substantive changes in the revised draft are
intended to facilitate the use of professional credentials in the
identity proofing process, and to reduce the need to use postal mail to
an address of record to issue credentials for level 3 remote
registration. Other changes to section 5 are minor explanations and
clarifications.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Active Attack                                                                          An attack on the authentication protocol where the Attacker transmits data to the Claimant, Credential Service Provider, Verifier, or Relying Party. Examples of active attacks include man-in-the-middle, impersonation, and session hijacking.

  Address of Record                                                                      The official location where an individual can be found. The address of record always includes the residential street address of an individual and may also include the mailing address of the individual. In very limited circumstances, an Army Post Office box number, Fleet Post Office box number or the street address of next of kin or of another contact individual can be used when a residential street address for the individual is not available.

  Approved                                                                               Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) approved or NIST recommended. An algorithm or technique that is either 1) specified in a FIPS or NIST Recommendation, or 2) adopted in a FIPS or NIST Recommendation.

  Applicant                                                                              A party undergoing the processes of registration and identity proofing.

  Assertion                                                                              A statement from a Verifier to a Relying Party (RP) that contains identity information about a Subscriber. Assertions may also contain verified attributes.

  Assertion Reference                                                                    A data object, created in conjunction with an assertion, which identifies the Verifier and includes a pointer to the full assertion held by the Verifier.

  Assurance                                                                              In the context of [OMB M-04-04](#GSA03) and this document, assurance is defined as 1) the degree of confidence in the vetting process used to establish the identity of an individual to whom the credential was issued, and 2) the degree of confidence that the individual who uses the credential is the individual to whom the credential was issued.

  Asymmetric Keys                                                                        Two related keys, a public key and a private key that are used to perform complementary operations, such as encryption and decryption or signature generation and signature verification.

  Attack                                                                                 An attempt by an unauthorized individual to fool a Verifier or a Relying Party into believing that the unauthorized individual in question is the Subscriber.

  Attacker                                                                               A party who acts with malicious intent to compromise an information system.

  Attribute                                                                              A claim of a named quality or characteristic inherent in or ascribed to someone or something. (See term in [\[ICAM\]](#ICAM) for more information.)

  Authentication                                                                         The process of establishing confidence in the identity of users or information systems.

  Authentication Protocol                                                                A defined sequence of messages between a Claimant and a Verifier that demonstrates that the Claimant has possession and control of a valid token to establish his/her identity, and optionally, demonstrates to the Claimant that he or she is communicating with the intended Verifier.

  Authentication Protocol Run                                                            An exchange of messages between a Claimant and a Verifier that results in authentication (or authentication failure) between the two parties.

  Authentication Secret                                                                  A generic term for any secret value that could be used by an Attacker to impersonate the Subscriber in an authentication protocol.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         These are further divided into *short-term authentication secrets*, which are only useful to an Attacker for a limited period of time, and *long-term authentication secrets*, which allow an Attacker to impersonate the Subscriber until they are manually reset. The token secret is the canonical example of a long term authentication secret, while the token authenticator, if it is different from the token secret, is usually a short term authentication secret.

  Authenticity                                                                           The property that data originated from its purported source.

  Bearer Assertion                                                                       An assertion that does not provide a mechanism for the Subscriber to prove that he or she is the rightful owner of the assertion. The RP has to assume that the assertion was issued to the Subscriber who presents the assertion or the corresponding assertion reference to the RP.

  Bit                                                                                    A binary digit: 0 or 1.

  Biometrics                                                                             Automated recognition of individuals based on their behavioral and biological characteristics.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         In this document, biometrics may be used to unlock authentication tokens and prevent repudiation of registration.

  Certificate Authority (CA)                                                             A trusted entity that issues and revokes public key certificates.

  Certificate Revocation List (CRL)                                                      A list of revoked public key certificates created and digitally signed by a Certificate Authority. See \[[RFC 5280](#RFC_5280)\].

  Challenge-Response Protocol                                                            An authentication protocol where the Verifier sends the Claimant a challenge (usually a random value or a nonce) that the Claimant combines with a secret (such as by hashing the challenge and a shared secret together, or by applying a private key operation to the challenge) to generate a response that is sent to the Verifier. The Verifier can independently verify the response generated by the Claimant (such as by re-computing the hash of the challenge and the shared secret and comparing to the response, or performing a public key operation on the response) and establish that the Claimant possesses and controls the secret.

  Claimant                                                                               A party whose identity is to be verified using an authentication protocol.

  Claimed Address                                                                        The physical location asserted by an individual (e.g. an applicant) where he/she can be reached. It includes the residential street address of an individual and may also include the mailing address of the individual.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         For example, a person with a foreign passport, living in the U.S., will need to give an address when going through the identity proofing process. This address would not be an “address of record” but a “claimed address.”

  Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA)   An interactive feature added to web-forms to distinguish use of the form by humans as opposed to automated agents. Typically, it requires entering text corresponding to a distorted image or from a sound stream.

  Cookie                                                                                 A character string, placed in a web browser’s memory, which is available to websites within the same Internet domain as the server that placed them in the web browser.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         Cookies are used for many purposes and may be assertions or may contain pointers to assertions. See Section 9.1.1 for more information.

  Credential                                                                             An object or data structure that authoritatively binds an identity (and optionally, additional attributes) to a token possessed and controlled by a Subscriber.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         While common usage often assumes that the credential is maintained by the Subscriber, this document also uses the term to refer to electronic records maintained by the CSP which establish a binding between the Subscriber’s token and identity.

  Credential Service Provider (CSP)                                                      A trusted entity that issues or registers Subscriber tokens and issues electronic credentials to Subscribers. The CSP may encompass Registration Authorities (RAs) and Verifiers that it operates. A CSP may be an independent third party, or may issue credentials for its own use.

  Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)                                                      An attack in which a Subscriber who is currently authenticated to an RP and connected through a secure session, browses to an Attacker’s website which causes the Subscriber to unknowingly invoke unwanted actions at the RP.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         For example, if a bank website is vulnerable to a CSRF attack, it may be possible for a Subscriber to unintentionally authorize a large money transfer, merely by viewing a malicious link in a webmail message while a connection to the bank is open in another browser window.

  Cross Site Scripting (XSS)                                                             A vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious code into an otherwise benign website. These scripts acquire the permissions of scripts generated by the target website and can therefore compromise the confidentiality and integrity of data transfers between the website and client. Websites are vulnerable if they display user supplied data from requests or forms without sanitizing the data so that it is not executable.

  Cryptographic Key                                                                      A value used to control cryptographic operations, such as decryption, encryption, signature generation or signature verification. For the purposes of this document, key requirements shall meet the minimum requirements stated in Table 2 of NIST SP 800-57 Part 1.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         See also Asymmetric keys, Symmetric key.

  Cryptographic Token                                                                    A token where the secret is a cryptographic key.

  Data Integrity                                                                         The property that data has not been altered by an unauthorized entity.

  Derived Credential                                                                     A credential issued based on proof of possession and control of a token associated with a previously issued credential, so as not to duplicate the identity proofing process.

  Digital Signature                                                                      An asymmetric key operation where the private key is used to digitally sign data and the public key is used to verify the signature. Digital signatures provide authenticity protection, integrity protection, and non-repudiation.

  Eavesdropping Attack                                                                   An attack in which an Attacker listens passively to the authentication protocol to capture information which can be used in a subsequent active attack to masquerade as the Claimant.

  Electronic Authentication (E-Authentication)                                           The process of establishing confidence in user identities electronically presented to an information system.

  Entropy                                                                                A measure of the amount of uncertainty that an Attacker faces to determine the value of a secret. Entropy is usually stated in bits. See [Appendix A](#_Appendix_A:_Estimating_Entropy and ).

  Extensible Mark-up Language (XML)                                                      Extensible Markup Language, abbreviated XML, describes a class of data objects called XML documents and partially describes the behavior of computer programs which process them.

  Federal Bridge Certification Authority (FBCA)                                          The FBCA is the entity operated by the Federal Public Key Infrastructure (FPKI) Management Authority that is authorized by the Federal PKI Policy Authority to create, sign, and issue public key certificates to Principal CAs.

  Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)                                    Title III of the E-Government Act requiring each federal agency to develop, document, and implement an agency-wide program to provide information security for the information and information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency, including those provided or managed by another agency, contractor, or other source.

  Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)                                         Under the Information Technology Management Reform Act (Public Law 104-106), the Secretary of Commerce approves standards and guidelines that are developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for Federal computer systems. These standards and guidelines are issued by NIST as Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) for use government-wide. NIST develops FIPS when there are compelling Federal government requirements such as for security and interoperability and there are no acceptable industry standards or solutions. See background information for more details.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         FIPS documents are available online through the FIPS home page:
                                                                                         
                                                                                         <http://www.nist.gov/itl/fips.cfm>

  Guessing Entropy                                                                       A measure of the difficulty that an Attacker has to guess the average password used in a system. In this document, entropy is stated in bits. When a password has n-bits of guessing entropy then an Attacker has as much difficulty guessing the average password as in guessing an n-bit random quantity. The Attacker is assumed to know the actual password frequency distribution. See [Appendix A](#_Appendix_A:_Estimating_Entropy and ).

  Hash Function                                                                          A function that maps a bit string of arbitrary length to a fixed length bit string. Approved hash functions satisfy the following properties:
                                                                                         
                                                                                         1\. (One-way) It is computationally infeasible to find any input that
                                                                                         maps to any pre-specified output, and
                                                                                         
                                                                                         2\. (Collision resistant) It is computationally infeasible to find any
                                                                                         two distinct inputs that map to the same output.

  Holder-of-Key Assertion                                                                An assertion that contains a reference to a symmetric key or a public key (corresponding to a private key) held by the Subscriber. The RP may authenticate the Subscriber by verifying that he or she can indeed prove possession and control of the referenced key.

  Identity                                                                               A set of attributes that uniquely describe a person within a given context.

  Identity Proofing                                                                      The process by which a CSP and a Registration Authority (RA) collect and verify information about a person for the purpose of issuing credentials to that person.

  Kerberos                                                                               A widely used authentication protocol developed at MIT. In “classic” Kerberos, users share a secret password with a Key Distribution Center (KDC). The user, Alice, who wishes to communicate with another user, Bob, authenticates to the KDC and is furnished a “ticket” by the KDC to use to authenticate with Bob.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         When Kerberos authentication is based on passwords, the protocol is known to be vulnerable to off-line dictionary attacks by eavesdroppers who capture the initial user-to- KDC exchange. Longer password length and complexity provide some mitigation to this vulnerability, although sufficiently long passwords tend to be cumbersome for users.

  Knowledge Based Authentication                                                         Authentication of an individual based on knowledge of information associated with his or her claimed identity in public databases. Knowledge of such information is considered to be private rather than secret, because it may be used in contexts other than authentication to a Verifier, thereby reducing the overall assurance associated with the authentication process.

  Man-in-the-Middle Attack (MitM)                                                        An attack on the authentication protocol run in which the Attacker positions himself or herself in between the Claimant and Verifier so that he can intercept and alter data traveling between them.

  Message                                                                                A cryptographic checksum on data that uses a symmetric key to detect both accidental and intentional modifications of the data. MACs provide authenticity and integrity protection, but not non-repudiation protection.
                                                                                         
  Authentication Code                                                                    
                                                                                         
  (MAC)                                                                                  

  Min-entropy                                                                            A measure of the difficulty that an Attacker has to guess the most commonly chosen password used in a system. In this document, entropy is stated in bits. When a password has n-bits of min-entropy then an Attacker requires as many trials to find a user with that password as is needed to guess an n-bit random quantity. The Attacker is assumed to know the most commonly used password(s). See [Appendix A](#_Appendix_A:_Estimating_Entropy and ).

  Multi-Factor                                                                           A characteristic of an authentication system or a token that uses more than one authentication factor.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         The three types of authentication factors are something you know, something you have, and something you are.

  Network                                                                                An open communications medium, typically the Internet, that is used to transport messages between the Claimant and other parties. Unless otherwise stated, no assumptions are made about the security of the network; it is assumed to be open and subject to active (i.e., impersonation, man-in-the-middle, session hijacking) and passive (i.e., eavesdropping) attack at any point between the parties (e.g., Claimant, Verifier, CSP or RP).

  Nonce                                                                                  A value used in security protocols that is never repeated with the same key. For example, nonces used as challenges in challenge-response authentication protocols must not be repeated until authentication keys are changed. Otherwise, there is a possibility of a replay attack. Using a nonce as a challenge is a different requirement than a random challenge, because a nonce is not necessarily unpredictable.

  Off-line Attack                                                                        An attack where the Attacker obtains some data (typically by eavesdropping on an authentication protocol run or by penetrating a system and stealing security files) that he/she is able to analyze in a system of his/her own choosing.

  Online Attack                                                                          An attack against an authentication protocol where the Attacker either assumes the role of a Claimant with a genuine Verifier or actively alters the authentication channel.

  Online Guessing Attack                                                                 An attack in which an Attacker performs repeated logon trials by guessing possible values of the token authenticator.

  Passive Attack                                                                         An attack against an authentication protocol where the Attacker intercepts data traveling along the network between the Claimant and Verifier, but does not alter the data (i.e., eavesdropping).

  Password                                                                               A secret that a Claimant memorizes and uses to authenticate his or her identity. Passwords are typically character strings.

  Personal Identification Number (PIN)                                                   A password consisting only of decimal digits.

  Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Card                                              Defined by \[FIPS 201\] as a physical artifact (e.g., identity card, smart card) issued to federal employees and contractors that contains stored credentials (e.g., photograph, cryptographic keys, digitized fingerprint representation) so that the claimed identity of the cardholder can be verified against the stored credentials by another person (human readable and verifiable) or an automated process (computer readable and verifiable).

  Personally Identifiable Information (PII)                                              Defined by GAO Report 08-536 as “Any information about an individual maintained by an agency, including (1) any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual‘s identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother‘s maiden name, or biometric records; and (2) any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information.”

  Pharming                                                                               An attack in which an Attacker corrupts an infrastructure service such as DNS (Domain Name Service) causing the Subscriber to be misdirected to a forged Verifier/RP, which could cause the Subscriber to reveal sensitive information, download harmful software or contribute to a fraudulent act.

  Phishing                                                                               An attack in which the Subscriber is lured (usually through an email) to interact with a counterfeit Verifier/RP and tricked into revealing information that can be used to masquerade as that Subscriber to the real Verifier/RP.

  Possession and control of a token                                                      The ability to activate and use the token in an authentication protocol.

  Practice Statement                                                                     A formal statement of the practices followed by the parties to an authentication process (i.e., RA, CSP, or Verifier). It usually describes the policies and practices of the parties and can become legally binding.

  Private Credentials                                                                    Credentials that cannot be disclosed by the CSP because the contents can be used to compromise the token. (For more discussion, see Section 7.1.1.)

  Private Key                                                                            The secret part of an asymmetric key pair that is used to digitally sign or decrypt data.

  Protected Session                                                                      A session wherein messages between two participants are encrypted and integrity is protected using a set of shared secrets called session keys.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         A participant is said to be *authenticated* if, during the session, he, she or it proves possession of a long term token in addition to the session keys, and if the other party can verify the identity associated with that token. If both participants are authenticated, the protected session is said to be *mutually authenticated*.

  Pseudonym                                                                              A false name.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         In this document, all unverified names are assumed to be pseudonyms.

  Public Credentials                                                                     Credentials that describe the binding in a way that does not compromise the token. (For more discussion, see Section 7.1.1.)

  Public Key                                                                             The public part of an asymmetric key pair that is used to verify signatures or encrypt data.

  Public Key Certificate                                                                 A digital document issued and digitally signed by the private key of a Certificate authority that binds the name of a Subscriber to a public key. The certificate indicates that the Subscriber identified in the certificate has sole control and access to the private key. See also \[[RFC 5280](#RFC_5280)\].

  Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)                                                        A set of policies, processes, server platforms, software and workstations used for the purpose of administering certificates and public-private key pairs, including the ability to issue, maintain, and revoke public key certificates.

  Registration                                                                           The process through which an Applicant applies to become a Subscriber of a CSP and an RA validates the identity of the Applicant on behalf of the CSP.

  Registration Authority (RA)                                                            A trusted entity that establishes and vouches for the identity or attributes of a Subscriber to a CSP. The RA may be an integral part of a CSP, or it may be independent of a CSP, but it has a relationship to the CSP(s).

  Relying Party (RP)                                                                     An entity that relies upon the Subscriber's token and credentials or a Verifier's assertion of a Claimant’s identity, typically to process a transaction or grant access to information or a system.

  Remote                                                                                 (*As in remote authentication or remote transaction*) An information exchange between network-connected devices where the information cannot be reliably protected end-to-end by a single organization’s security controls.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         Note: Any information exchange across the Internet is considered remote.

  Replay Attack                                                                          An attack in which the Attacker is able to replay previously captured messages (between a legitimate Claimant and a Verifier) to masquerade as that Claimant to the Verifier or vice versa.

  Risk Assessment                                                                        The process of identifying the risks to system security and determining the probability of occurrence, the resulting impact, and additional safeguards that would mitigate this impact. Part of Risk Management and synonymous with Risk Analysis.

  Salt                                                                                   A non-secret value that is used in a cryptographic process, usually to ensure that the results of computations for one instance cannot be reused by an Attacker.

  Secondary Authenticator                                                                A temporary secret, issued by the Verifier to a successfully authenticated Subscriber as part of an assertion protocol. This secret is subsequently used, by the Subscriber, to authenticate to the RP.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         Examples of secondary authenticators include bearer assertions, assertion references, and Kerberos session keys.

  Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)                                                             An authentication and security protocol widely implemented in browsers and web servers. SSL has been superseded by the newer Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol; TLS 1.0 is effectively SSL version 3.1.

  Security Assertion Mark-up Language (SAML)                                             An XML-based security specification developed by the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) for exchanging authentication (and authorization) information between trusted entities over the Internet. See \[[SAML](#SAML)\].

  SAML Authentication Assertion                                                          A SAML assertion that conveys information from a Verifier to an RP about a successful act of authentication that took place between the Verifier and a Subscriber.

  Session Hijack Attack                                                                  An attack in which the Attacker is able to insert himself or herself between a Claimant and a Verifier subsequent to a successful authentication exchange between the latter two parties. The Attacker is able to pose as a Subscriber to the Verifier or vice versa to control session data exchange. Sessions between the Claimant and the Relying Party can also be similarly compromised.

  Shared Secret                                                                          A secret used in authentication that is known to the Claimant and the Verifier.

  Social Engineering                                                                     The act of deceiving an individual into revealing sensitive information by associating with the individual to gain confidence and trust.

  Special Publication (SP)                                                               A type of publication issued by NIST. Specifically, the Special Publication 800-series reports on the Information Technology Laboratory's research, guidelines, and outreach efforts in computer security, and its collaborative activities with industry, government, and academic organizations.

  Strongly Bound Credentials                                                             Credentials that describe the binding between a user and token in a tamper-evident fashion. (For more discussion, see Section 7.1.1.)

  Subscriber                                                                             A party who has received a credential or token from a CSP.

  Symmetric Key                                                                          A cryptographic key that is used to perform both the cryptographic operation and its inverse, for example to encrypt and decrypt, or create a message authentication code and to verify the code.

  Token                                                                                  Something that the Claimant possesses and controls (typically a cryptographic module or password) that is used to authenticate the Claimant’s identity.

  Token Authenticator                                                                    The output value generated by a token. The ability to generate valid token authenticators on demand proves that the Claimant possesses and controls the token. Protocol messages sent to the Verifier are dependent upon the token authenticator, but they may or may not explicitly contain it.

  Token Secret                                                                           The secret value, contained within a token, which is used to derive token authenticators.

  Transport Layer Security (TLS)                                                         An authentication and security protocol widely implemented in browsers and web servers. TLS is defined by \[[RFC 2246](#_General_References)\], \[[RFC 3546](#_General_References)\], and \[[RFC 5246](#RFC_5246)\]. TLS is similar to the older Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, and TLS 1.0 is effectively SSL version 3.1. NIST SP 800-52, *Guidelines for the Selection and Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) Implementations* specifies how TLS is to be used in government applications.

  Trust Anchor                                                                           A public or symmetric key that is trusted because it is directly built into hardware or software, or securely provisioned via out-of-band means, rather than because it is vouched for by another trusted entity (e.g. in a public key certificate).

  Unverified Name                                                                        A Subscriber name that is not verified as meaningful by identity proofing.

  Valid                                                                                  In reference to an ID, the quality of not being expired or revoked.

  Verified Name                                                                          A Subscriber name that has been verified by identity proofing.

  Verifier                                                                               An entity that verifies the Claimant’s identity by verifying the Claimant’s possession and control of a token using an authentication protocol. To do this, the Verifier may also need to validate credentials that link the token and identity and check their status.

  Verifier Impersonation Attack                                                          A scenario where the Attacker impersonates the Verifier in an authentication protocol, usually to capture information that can be used to masquerade as a Claimant to the real Verifier.

  Weakly Bound Credentials                                                               Credentials that describe the binding between a user and token in a manner than can be modified without invalidating the credential. (For more discussion, see Section 7.1.1.)

  Zeroize                                                                                Overwrite a memory location with data consisting entirely of bits with the value zero so that the data is destroyed and not recoverable. This is often contrasted with deletion methods that merely destroy reference to data within a file system rather than the data itself.

  Zero-knowledge Password Protocol                                                       A password based authentication protocol that allows a claimant to authenticate to a Verifier without revealing the password to the Verifier. Examples of such protocols are EKE, SPEKE and SRP.

        ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In accordance with \[[OMB M-04-04](#OMB_0404)\], e-authentication is the
process of establishing confidence in user identities electronically
presented to an information system. Systems can use the authenticated
identity to determine if that individual is authorized to perform an
electronic transaction. In most cases, the authentication and
transaction take place across an open network such as the Internet;
however, in some cases access to the network may be limited and access
control decisions may take this into account.

The e-authentication model used in these guidelines reflects current
technologies and architectures used in government. More complex models
that separate functions, such as issuing credentials and providing
attributes, among larger numbers of parties are also possible and may
have advantages in some classes of applications. While a simpler model
is used in this document, it does not preclude agencies from separating
these functions.

E-authentication begins with *registration*. The usual sequence for
registration proceeds as follows. An *Applicant* applies to a
*Registration Authority (RA)* to become a *Subscriber* of a *Credential
Service Provider (CSP)*. If approved, the Subscriber is issued a
*credential* by the CSP which binds a *token* to an identifier (and
possibly one or more attributes that the RA has verified). The token may
be issued by the CSP, generated directly by the Subscriber, or provided
by a third party. The CSP registers the token by creating a *credential*
that binds the token to an identifier and possibly other attributes that
the RA has verified. The token and credential may be used in subsequent
authentication events.

The name specified in a credential may either be a *verified name* or an
*unverified name*. If the RA has determined that the name is officially
associated with a real person and the Subscriber is the person who is
entitled to use that identity, the name is considered a verified name.
If the RA has not verified the Subscriber’s name, or the name is known
to differ from the official name, the name is considered a *pseudonym*.
The process used to verify a Subscriber’s association with a name is
called identity proofing, and is performed by an RA that registers
Subscribers with the CSP. At Level 1, identity proofing is not required
so names in credentials and assertions are assumed to be pseudonyms. At
Level 2, identity proofing is required, but the credential may assert
the verified name or a pseudonym. In the case of a pseudonym, the CSP
shall retain the name verified during registration. Level 2 credentials
and assertions shall specify whether the name is a verified name or a
pseudonym. This information assists *Relying Parties (RPs)* in making
access control or authorization decisions. In most cases, only verified
names may be specified in credentials and assertions at Levels 3 and
4.[^4] (The required use of a verified name at higher levels of
assurance is derived from OMB M-04-04 and is specific to Federal IT
systems, rather than a general e-authentication requirement.)

In this document, the party to be authenticated is called a *Claimant*
and the party verifying that identity is called a *Verifier*. When a
*Claimant* successfully demonstrates possession and control of a token
to a *Verifier* through an *authentication protocol,* the Verifier can
verify that the Claimant is the Subscriber named in the corresponding
credential. The Verifier passes on an assertion about the identity of
the Subscriber to the Relying Party (RP). That assertion includes
identity information about a Subscriber, such as the Subscriber name, an
identifier assigned at registration, or other Subscriber attributes that
were verified in the registration process (subject to the policies of
the CSP and the needs of the application). Where the Verifier is also
the RP, the assertion may be implicit. The RP can use the authenticated
information provided by the Verifier to make access control or
authorization decisions.

Authentication establishes confidence in the Claimant’s identity, and in
some cases in the Claimant’s personal attributes (for example the
Subscriber is a US Citizen, is a student at a particular university, or
is assigned a particular number or code by an agency or organization).
Authentication does not determine the Claimant’s authorizations or
access privileges; this is a separate decision. RPs (e.g., government
agencies) will use a Subscriber’s authenticated identity and attributes
with other factors to make access control or authorization decisions.

As part of authentication, mechanisms such as device identity or
geo-location could be used to identify or prevent possible
authentication false positives. While these mechanisms do not directly
increase the assurance level for authentication, they can enforce
security policies and mitigate risks. In many cases, the authentication
process and services will be shared by many applications and agencies.
However, it is the individual agency or application acting as the RP
that shall make the decision to grant access or process a transaction
based on the specific application requirements.

The various entities and interactions that comprise the e-authentication
model used here are illustrated below in Figure 1. The shaded box on the
left shows the registration, credential issuance, maintenance
activities, and the interactions between the Subscriber/Claimant, the RA
and the CSP. The usual sequence of interactions is as follows:

1.  An individual Applicant applies to an RA through a
    registration process.

2.  The RA identity proofs that Applicant.

3.  On successful identity proofing, the RA sends the CSP a registration
    confirmation message.

4.  A secret token and a corresponding credential are established
    between the CSP and the new Subscriber.

5.  The CSP maintains the credential, its status, and the registration
    data collected for the lifetime of the credential (at a
    minimum).[^5] The Subscriber maintains his or her token.

Other sequences are less common, but could also achieve the same
functional requirements.

The shaded box on the right side of Figure 1 shows the entities and the
interactions related to using a token and credential to perform
e-authentication. When the Subscriber needs to authenticate to perform a
transaction, he or she becomes a Claimant to a Verifier. The
interactions are as follows:

1.  The Claimant proves to the Verifier that he or she possesses and
    controls the token through an authentication protocol.

2.  The Verifier interacts with the CSP to validate the credential that
    binds the Subscriber’s identity to his or her token.

3.  If the Verifier is separate from the RP (application), the Verifier
    provides[^6] an assertion about the Subscriber to the RP, which uses
    the information in the assertion to make an access control or
    authorization decision.

4.  An authenticated session is established between the Subscriber and
    the RP.

In some cases the Verifier does not need to directly communicate with
the CSP to complete the authentication activity (e.g., some uses of
digital certificates). Therefore, the dashed line between the Verifier
and the CSP represents a logical link between the two entities rather
than a physical link. In some implementations, the Verifier, RP and the
CSP functions may be distributed and separated as shown in Figure 1;
however, if these functions reside on the same platform, the
interactions between the components are local messages between
applications running on the same system rather than protocols over
shared untrusted networks.

As noted above, CSPs maintain status information about credentials they
issue. CSPs will generally assign a finite lifetime when issuing
credentials to limit the maintenance period. When the status changes, or
when the credentials near expiration, credentials may be renewed or
re-issued; or, the credential may be revoked and/or destroyed.
Typically, the Subscriber authenticates to the CSP using his or her
existing, unexpired token and credential in order to request re-issuance
of a new token and credential. If the Subscriber fails to request token
and credential re-issuance prior to their expiration or revocation, he
or she may be required to repeat the registration process to obtain a
new token and credential. The CSP may choose to accept a request during
a grace period after expiration.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The previous section introduced the different participants in the
conceptual e-authentication model. This section provides additional
details regarding the relationships and responsibilities of the
participants involved with Registration, Credential Issuance and
Maintenance (see the box on the left hand side of Figure 1).

A user may be referred to as the Applicant, Subscriber, or Claimant,
depending on the stage in the lifecycle of the credential. An Applicant
requests credentials from a CSP. If the Applicant is approved and
credentials are issued by a CSP, the user is then termed a Subscriber of
that CSP. A user may be a Subscriber of multiple CSPs to obtain
appropriate credentials for different applications. A Claimant
participates in an authentication protocol with a Verifier to prove they
are the Subscriber named in a particular credential.

The CSP establishes a mechanism to uniquely identify each Subscriber,
register the Subscriber’s tokens, and track the credentials issued to
that Subscriber for each token. The Subscriber may be given credentials
to go with the token at the time of registration, or credentials may be
generated later as needed. Subscribers have a duty to maintain control
of their tokens and comply with the responsibilities to the CSP. The CSP
(or the RA) maintains registration records for each Subscriber to allow
recovery of registration records.

There is always a relationship between the RA and CSP. In the simplest
and perhaps the most common case, the RA and CSP are separate functions
of the same entity. However, an RA might be part of a company or
organization that registers Subscribers with an independent CSP, or
several different CSPs. Therefore a CSP may have an integral RA, or it
may have relationships with multiple independent RAs, and an RA may have
relationships with different CSPs as well.

Section 5 specifies requirements for the registration, identity proofing
and issuance processes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The classic paradigm for authentication systems identifies three factors
as the cornerstone of authentication:

-   *Something you know* (for example, a password)

-   *Something you have* (for example, an ID badge or a
    cryptographic key)

-   *Something you are* (for example, a fingerprint or other
    biometric data)

Multi-factor authentication refers to the use of more than one of the
factors listed above. The strength of authentication systems is largely
determined by the number of factors incorporated by the system.
Implementations that use two factors are considered to be stronger than
those that use only one factor; systems that incorporate all three
factors are stronger than systems that only incorporate two of the
factors. (As discussed in Section 4.1, other types of information, such
as location data or device identity, may be used by an RP or Verifier to
reject or challenge a claimed identity, but they are not considered
authentication factors.)

In e-authentication, the base paradigm is slightly different: the
Claimant possesses and controls a token that has been registered with
the CSP and is used to prove the bearer’s identity. The token contains a
secret the Claimant can use to prove that he or she is the Subscriber
named in a particular credential.[^7] In e-authentication, the Claimant
authenticates to a system or application over a network by proving that
he or she has possession and control of a token. The token provides an
output called a token authenticator. This output is used in the
authentication process to prove that the Claimant possesses and controls
the token (refer to Section 6.1 for more details), demonstrating that
the Claimant is the person to whom the token was issued. Depending on
the type of token, this authenticator may or may not be unique for
individual authentication operations.

The secrets contained in tokens are based on either *public key pairs*
(asymmetric keys) or *shared secrets*.

A *public key* and a related private key comprise a public key pair. The
*private key* is stored on the token and is used by the Claimant to
prove possession and control of the token. A Verifier, knowing the
Claimant’s public key through some credential (typically a *public key
certificate*), can use an authentication protocol to verify the
Claimant’s identity, by proving that the Claimant has possession and
control of the associated private key token.

Shared secrets stored on tokens may be either *symmetric keys* or
passwords. While they can be used in similar protocols, one important
difference between the two is how they relate to the subscriber. While
symmetric keys are generally stored in hardware or software that the
Subscriber controls, passwords tend to be memorized by the Subscriber.
As such, keys are something the Subscriber has, while passwords are
something he or she knows. Since passwords are committed to memory, they
usually do not have as many possible values as cryptographic keys, and,
in many protocols, are vulnerable to network attacks that are
impractical for keys. Moreover the entry of passwords into systems
(usually through a keyboard) presents the opportunity for very simple
keyboard logging attacks, and it may also allow those nearby to learn
the password by watching it being entered. Therefore, keys and passwords
demonstrate somewhat separate authentication properties (something you
have rather than something you know). However, when using either public
key pairs or shared secrets, the Subscriber has a duty to maintain
exclusive control of his or her token, since possession and control of
the token is used to authenticate the Claimant’s identity. Token threats
are discussed more in Section 6.2.

In this document, e-authentication tokens always contain a secret. So,
some of the classic authentication factors do not apply directly to
e-authentication. For example, an ID badge is *something you have*, and
is useful when authenticating to a human (e.g., a guard), but is not a
token for e-authentication. Authentication factors classified as
*something you know* are not necessarily secrets, either. Knowledge
based authentication, where the claimant is prompted to answer questions
that can be confirmed from public databases, also does not constitute an
acceptable secret for e-authentication. More generally, *something you
are* does not generally constitute a secret. Accordingly, this
recommendation does not permit the use of biometrics as a token.

However, this recommendation does accept the notional model that
authentication systems that incorporate all three factors offer better
security than systems that only incorporate two of the factors. An
e-authentication system may incorporate multiple factors in either of
two ways. The system may be implemented so that multiple factors are
presented to the Verifier, or some factors may be used to protect a
secret that will be presented to the Verifier. If multiple factors are
presented to the Verifier, each will need to be a token (and therefore
contain a secret). If a single factor is presented to the Verifier, the
additional factors are used to protect the token and need not themselves
be tokens.

For example, consider a piece of hardware (the token) which contains a
cryptographic key (the token secret) where access is protected with a
fingerprint. When used with the biometric, the cryptographic key
produces an output (the token authenticator) which is used in the
authentication process to authenticate the Claimant. An impostor must
steal the encrypted key (by stealing the hardware) and replicate the
fingerprint to use the token. This specification considers such a device
to effectively provide two factor authentication, although the actual
authentication protocol between the Verifier and the Claimant simply
proves possession of the key.

As noted above, biometrics, when employed as a single factor of
authentication, do not constitute acceptable secrets for
e-authentication, but they do have their place in this specification.
Biometric characteristics are unique personal attributes that can be
used to verify the identity of a person who is physically present at the
point of verification. They include facial features, fingerprints, DNA,
iris and retina scans, voiceprints and many other characteristics. This
publication recommends that biometrics be used in the registration
process for higher levels of assurance to later help prevent a
Subscriber who is registered from repudiating the registration, to help
identify those who commit registration fraud, and to unlock tokens.

Section 6 provides guidelines on the various types of tokens that may be
used for electronic authentication.

<span id="_Toc139354568" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc74456261" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc237074434" class="anchor"></span></span></span>Credentials
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As described in the preceding sections, e-authentication credentials
bind a token to the Subscriber’s name as part of the issuance process.
Credentials are issued and maintained by the CSP; Verifiers use the
credentials to authenticate the Claimant’s identity based on possession
and control of the corresponding token. This section provides additional
background regarding the relationship of credentials in the
e-authentication model with traditional (paper) credentials and
describes common e-authentication credentials.

Paper credentials are documents that attest to the identity or other
attributes of an individual or entity called the subject of the
credentials. Some common paper credentials include passports, birth
certificates, driver’s licenses, and employee identity cards. The
authenticity of paper credentials is established in a variety of ways:
traditionally perhaps by a signature or a seal, special papers and inks,
high quality engraving, and today by more complex mechanisms, such as
holograms, that make the credentials recognizable and difficult to copy
or forge. In some cases, simple possession of the credentials is
sufficient to establish that the physical holder of the credential is
indeed the subject of the credentials. More commonly, the credentials
contain information such as the subject’s description, a picture of the
subject or the handwritten signature of the subject, which can be used
to authenticate that the holder of the credentials is indeed the subject
of the credentials. When these paper credentials are presented
in-person, the information contained in those credentials can be checked
to verify that the physical holder of the credential is the subject.

E-authentication credentials may be considered the electronic analog to
paper credentials. In both cases, a valid credential authoritatively
binds an identity to the necessary information for verifying that a
person is entitled to claim that identity. However, the use cases differ
in several significant aspects.

The Subject simply possesses and presents the paper credentials in most
authentication scenarios. Since they are generally easy to copy, mere
possession of a valid electronic credential is rarely a sufficient basis
for successful authentication. The e-authentication Claimant possesses a
token and presents a token authenticator, but is not necessarily in
possession of the electronic credentials. For example, password database
entries are considered to be credentials for the purpose of this
document but are possessed by the Verifier. X.509 public key
certificates are a classic example of credentials the Claimant can (and
often does) possess.

As was the case for paper credentials, in order to authenticate a
Claimant using an electronic credential, the Verifier shall also
validate the credential itself (i.e. confirm that the credential was
issued by an authorized CSP and has not subsequently expired or been
revoked.) There are two ways this can be done: If the credential has
been signed by the CSP, the verifier can validate it by checking the
signature. Otherwise, validation may be done interactively by querying
the CSP directly through a secure protocol.

In the remainder of this document, the term “credentials” refers to
electronic credentials unless explicitly noted. Section 7 provides
guidelines for token and credential management activities that are
applicable to electronic authentication.

<span id="_Toc168278072" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc237074435" class="anchor"></span></span>Authentication Process
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The authentication process begins with the Claimant demonstrating
possession and control of a token that is bound to the asserted identity
to the Verifier through an authentication protocol. Once possession and
control has been demonstrated, the Verifier verifies that the credential
remains valid, usually by interacting with the CSP.

The exact nature of the interaction between the Verifier and the
Claimant during the authentication protocol is extremely important in
determining the overall security of the system. Well designed protocols
can protect the integrity and confidentiality of traffic between the
Claimant and the Verifier both during and after the authentication
exchange, and it can help limit the damage that can be done by an
Attacker masquerading as a legitimate Verifier. Additionally, mechanisms
located at the Verifier can mitigate online guessing attacks against
lower entropy secrets like passwords and PINs by limiting the rate at
which an Attacker can make authentication attempts or otherwise delaying
incorrect attempts. (Generally, this is done by keeping track of and
limiting the number of unsuccessful attempts, since the premise of an
online guessing attack is that most attempts will fail.)

The Verifier is a functional role, but is frequently implemented in
combination with the CSP and/or the RP. If the Verifier is a separate
entity from the CSP, it is often desirable to ensure that the Verifier
does not learn the subscriber’s token secret in the process of
authentication, or at least to ensure that the Verifier does not have
unrestricted access to secrets stored by the CSP.

Section 8 provides guidelines for the various types of protocols used by
the Verifier to authenticate the Claimant/Subscriber within the
e-authentication model.

<span id="_Toc168278074" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc74456263" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc237074436" class="anchor"></span></span></span>Assertions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Upon completion of the authentication process, the Verifier generates an
assertion containing the result of the authentication and provides it to
the RP. If the Verifier is implemented in combination with the RP, the
assertion is implicit. If the Verifier is a separate entity from the RP,
the assertion is used to pass information about the Claimant or the
authentication process from the Verifier to the RP. Assertions may be
communicated directly to the RP, or can be forwarded through the
Claimant, which has further implications for system design.

An RP trusts an assertion based on the source, the time of creation, and
attributes associated with the Claimant. The Verifier is responsible for
providing a mechanism by which the integrity of the assertion can be
confirmed. The RP is responsible for authenticating the source (the
Verifier) and for confirming the integrity of the assertion. When the
Verifier passes the assertion through the Claimant, the Verifier shall
protect the integrity of the assertion in such a way that it cannot be
modified by the Claimant. However, if the Verifier and the RP
communicate directly, a protected session may be used to provide the
integrity protection. When sending assertions across an open network,
the Verifier is responsible for ensuring that any sensitive Subscriber
information contained in the assertion can only be extracted by an RP
that it trusts to maintain the information’s confidentiality.

Examples of assertions include:

-   *Cookies* – Cookies are character strings, placed in memory, which
    are available to websites within the same Internet domain as the
    server that placed them in the web browser. Cookies are used for
    many purposes and may be assertions or may contain pointers to
    assertions.[^8]

-   *SAML Assertions* – SAML assertions are specified using a mark-up
    language intended for describing security assertions. They can be
    used by a Verifier to make a statement to an RP about the identity
    of a Claimant. SAML assertions may optionally be digitally signed.

-   *Kerberos Tickets* – Kerberos Tickets allow a ticket granting
    authority to issue session keys to two authenticated parties using
    symmetric key based encapsulation schemes.

Section 9 provides guidelines for the use of assertions in
authentication protocols.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An RP relies on results of an electronic authentication protocol to
establish confidence in the identity or attributes of a Subscriber for
the purpose of some transaction. RPs will use a Subscriber’s
authenticated identity, the overall authentication assurance level, and
other factors to make access control or authorization decisions. The
Verifier and the RP may be the same entity, or they may be separate
entities. If they are separate entities, the RP normally receives an
assertion from the Verifier. The RP ensures that the assertion came from
a Verifier trusted by the RP. The RP also processes any additional
information in the assertion, such as personal attributes or expiration
times.

Section 9 provides guidelines for the assertions that may be used by RPs
to establish confidence in the identities of Claimants when the RP and
the Verifier are not co-located.

<span id="_Toc168278078" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc237074438" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc133326850" class="anchor"></span></span></span>Calculating the Overall Authentication Assurance Level
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The overall authentication assurance level is based on the low watermark
of the assurance levels for each of the components of the architecture.
For instance, to achieve an overall assurance level of 3:

-   The registration and identity proofing process shall, at a minimum,
    use Level 3 processes or higher.

-   The token (or combination of tokens) used shall have an assurance
    level of 3 or higher.

-   The binding between the identity proofing and the token(s), if
    proofing is done separately from token issuance, shall be
    established at level 3.

-   The authentication protocols used shall have a Level 3 assurance
    level or higher.

-   The token and credential management processes shall use a Level 3
    assurance level or higher.

-   Authentication assertions (if used) shall have a Level 3 assurance
    or higher.

The low watermark is the basis for the overall level because the lowest
level will likely be the target of the Attacker. For example, if a
system uses a token for authentication that has Level 2 assurance, but
uses other mechanisms that have Level 3 assurance, the Attacker will
likely focus on gaining access to the token since it is easier to attack
a system component meeting assurance Level 2 rather than attacking those
meeting assurance Level 3. (See Sections 5 through 9 for information on
assurance levels for each area.)

    1.  Overview
        --------

In the registration process, an Applicant undergoes identity proofing by
a trusted RA. If the RA is able to verify the Applicant’s identity, the
CSP registers or gives the Applicant a token and issues a credential as
needed to bind that token to the identity or some related attribute. The
Applicant is now a Subscriber of the CSP and may use the token as a
Claimant in an authentication protocol. This section describes the
requirements for registration and for token and credential issuance.

The RA can be a part of the CSP, or the RA can be a separate and
independent entity; however, a trusted relationship always exists
between the RA and CSP. Where the RA and CSP are separate entities, the
trust relationship is often contractual, but the trust relationship may
also be based on laws and regulations, such as when a notary performs
the RA function. The RA or CSP maintain records of the registration. The
RA and CSP can provide services on behalf of an organization or may
provide services to the public. The processes and mechanisms available
to the RA for identity proofing may differ as a result. Where the RA
operates on behalf of an organization, the identity proofing process may
be able to leverage a pre-existing relationship (e.g., the Applicant is
an employee or student). Where the RA provides services to the public,
the identity proofing process is generally limited to confirming
publicly available information and previously issued credentials.

The registration and identity proofing processes are designed based on
the required assurance level, to ensure that the RA/CSP knows the true
identity of the Applicant. Specifically, the requirements include
measures to ensure that:

-   A person with the Applicant’s claimed attributes exists, and those
    attributes are sufficient to uniquely identify a single person;

-   The Applicant whose token is registered is in fact the person who is
    entitled to the identity;

-   It is difficult for the Claimant to later repudiate the registration
    and dispute an authentication using the Subscriber’s token.

An Applicant may appear in person to register, or the Applicant may
register remotely. Somewhat different processes and mechanisms apply to
identity proofing in each case. Remote registration is limited to Levels
1 through 3.

After successful identity proofing of the Applicant, the RA registers
the Applicant, and then the CSP is responsible for token and credential
issuance for the new Subscriber (additional CSP responsibilities are
discussed further in Section 7). Issuance includes creation of the
token. Depending on the type of token being used, the CSP will either
create a new token and supply the token to the Subscriber, or require
the Subscriber to register a token that the Applicant already possesses
or has newly created. In either case, the mechanism for transporting the
token from the token origination point to the Subscriber may need to be
secured to ensure that the confidentiality and integrity of the newly
established token is maintained and that token is in possession of
correct Applicant.

The CSP is also responsible for the creation of a credential that binds
the Subscriber’s identity to his or her token. Optionally, the CSP may
include other verified attributes about the Subscriber within the
credential, such as his or her organizational affiliation, policies, or
constraints for token use.

In models where the registration and identity proofing take place
separately from credential issuance, the CSP is responsible for
verifying that the credential is being issued to the same person who was
identity proofed by the RA. In this model, issuance must be strongly
bound to registration and identity proofing so that an Attacker cannot
pose as a newly registered Subscriber and attempt to collect a
token/credential meant for the actual Subscriber. This attack, and
similar attacks, can be thwarted by the methods described in Section
5.3.1 (below Table 3), which describes which techniques are considered
appropriate for establishing the necessary binding at the various
assurance levels.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are two general categories of threats to the registration process:
impersonation and either compromise or malfeasance of the infrastructure
(RAs and CSPs). This recommendation concentrates on addressing
impersonation threats. Infrastructure threats are addressed by normal
computer security controls (e.g., separation of duties, record keeping,
independent audits) and are outside the scope of this document[^9].

The threats to the issuance process include impersonation attacks and
threats to the transport mechanism for the token and credential
issuance. Table 1 lists the threats related to registration and
issuance.

Threat Mitigation Strategies {#threat-mitigation-strategies .header3}
----------------------------

Registration threats can be deterred by making impersonation more
difficult to accomplish or increasing the likelihood of detection. This
recommendation deals primarily with methods for making impersonation
more difficult; however, it does prescribe certain methods and
procedures that may help to prove who carried out an impersonation. At
each level, methods are employed to determine that a person with the
claimed identity exists, that the Applicant is the person who is
entitled to the claimed identity, and that the Applicant cannot later
repudiate the registration. As the level of assurance increases, the
methods employed provide increasing resistance to casual, systematic and
insider impersonation. Table 2 lists strategies for mitigating threats
to the registration and issuance processes.

  **Activity**   **Threat/Attack**                   **Mitigation Strategy**
  Registration   Impersonation of claimed identity   RAs request documentation that provides a specified level of confidence (or assurance) in the identity of the Applicant and makes it more difficult for imposters to successfully pass the identity proofing step. Government issued documents such as driver’s licenses, and passports presented by the Applicant are often used to assert the identity of the Applicant.
                                                     Have the Applicant provide non-government issued documentation (e.g. electricity bills in the name of the Applicant with the current address of the Applicant printed on the bill, or a credit card bill) to help in achieving a higher level of confidence in the identity of the Applicant.
                 Repudiation of registration         Have the Applicant sign a form acknowledging participation in the registration activity.
  ** **          ** **                               ** **
  Issuance       Disclosure                          Issue the token in person, physically mail it in a sealed envelope to a secure location, or use a protected session to send the token electronically.
                 Tampering                           Issue credentials in person, physically mailing storage media in a sealed envelope, or through the use of a communication protocol that protects the integrity of the session data.
                                                     Establish a procedure that allows the Subscriber to authenticate the CSP as the source of any token and credential data that he or she may receive.
                 Unauthorized issuance               Establish procedures to ensure that the individual who receives the token is the same individual who participated in the registration procedure.
                                                     Implement a dual-control issuance process that ensures two independent individuals shall cooperate in order to issue a token and/or credential.

Registration and Issuance Assurance Levels
------------------------------------------

The following sections list the NIST recommendations for registration
and issuance for the four levels corresponding to the OMB guidance. As
noted in the OMB guidance, Levels 1 and 2 recognize the use of
pseudonymous credentials. When pseudonymous credentials are used to
imply membership in a group, the level of proofing shall be consistent
with the requirements for the credential of that level. Explicit
requirements for registration processes for pseudonymous credentials are
not specified, as they are unique to the membership criteria for each
specific group.

<span id="_Ref303441658" class="anchor"><span id="_Ref306631193" class="anchor"><span id="_Ref306632550" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc237074444" class="anchor"></span></span></span></span>General Requirements per Assurance Level {#general-requirements-per-assurance-level .header3}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For levels 2 and above records of registration shall be maintained
either by the RA or by the CSP, depending on the context. Either the RA
or the CSP shall maintain a record of each individual whose identity has
been verified and the steps taken to verify his or her identity,
including any information collected from the Applicant in compliance
with the sections below. The CSP shall have the capability to provide
records of identity proofing to RPs if required[^11]. The identity
proofing and registration processes shall be performed according to
applicable written policy or *practice statement* that specifies the
particular steps taken to verify identities.

For Levels 2 and above, if the RA and CSP are remotely located and
communicate over a network, the entire registration transaction between
the RA and CSP shall occur over a mutually authenticated protected
session. Equivalently, the transaction may consist of time-stamped or
sequenced messages signed by their source and encrypted for their
recipient. In either case, Approved cryptography is required.<span
id="_Toc213576494" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc213579457"
class="anchor"><span id="_Toc214329540" class="anchor"><span

class="anchor"><span id="_Toc168278086"
class="anchor"></span></span></span></span></span></span>

The CSP shall be able to uniquely identify each Subscriber and the
associated tokens and the credentials issued to that Subscriber. The CSP
shall be capable of conveying this information to Verifiers. At Level 1,
the name associated with the Subscriber is provided by the Applicant and
accepted without verification. At Level 2, the identifier associated
with the Subscriber may be pseudonymous but the RA or CSP shall retain
the actual identity of the Subscriber. In addition, pseudonymous Level 2
credentials shall be distinguishable from Level 2 credentials that
contain verified names.

At Level 3 and above, the name associated with the Subscriber shall be
verified. At all levels, personally identifiable information (PII)
collected as part of the registration process shall be protected, and
all privacy requirements shall be satisfied.

The following text establishes registration requirements specific to
each level, except as noted in the following subsections. There are no
level-specific requirements at Level 1. Both in-person and remote
registration are permitted for Levels 2 and 3. Remote registration
requirements are designed to permit fully automated solutions. However,
implementations may also leverage call centers or online assistance as a
substitute or complement for fully automated solutions. Explicit
requirements are specified for each scenario in Levels 2 and 3. At Level
4, only in-person registration is permitted.

At Level 2 and higher, the Applicant supplies his or her full legal
name, an address of record, and date of birth, and may, subject to the
policy of the RA or CSP, also supply other PII. Detailed level-by-level
identity proofing requirements are stated in Table 3.

In some contexts, once an agency has met the minimum registration
requirements for an assurance level, the agency may choose to use
additional knowledge based authentication methods to increase confidence
in the registration process. For example, an Applicant could be asked to
supply non-public information on his or her past dealing with the agency
that could help confirm the Applicant’s identity.

The sensitive data collected during the registration and identity
proofing stage shall be protected at all times (i.e., transmission,
storage) to ensure their security and confidentiality. Additionally, the
results of the identity proofing step (which may include background
investigations of the Applicant) have to be protected to ensure source
authentication, confidentiality, and integrity.

  ------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ----------------

Remote registration at Levels 2 and 3 requires confirmation of a
financial or utility account number. The requirement for a financial
account or utility account number may be satisfied by a cellular or
landline telephone service account under the following conditions:

-   the phone is associated in Records with the Applicant's name and
    address of record; and

-   the applicant demonstrates that they are able to send or receive
    messages at the phone number.

Registration, identity proofing, token creation/issuance, and credential
issuance are separate processes that can be broken up into a number of
separate physical encounters or electronic transactions. (Two electronic
transactions are considered to be separate if they are not part of the
same protected session.) In these cases, the following methods shall be
used to ensure that the same party acts as Applicant throughout the
processes:

-   At Level 1, there is no specific requirement, however some effort
    should be made to uniquely identify and track applications.

-   At Level 2: For electronic transactions, the Applicant shall
    identify himself/herself in any new transaction (beyond the first
    transaction or encounter) by presenting a temporary secret which was
    established during a prior transaction or encounter, or sent to the
    Applicant’s phone number, email address, or physical address
    of record. For physical transactions, the Applicant shall identify
    himself/herself in person by either using a secret as described
    above, or by biometric verification (comparing a captured biometric
    sample to a reference biometric sample that was enrolled during a
    prior encounter).

-   At Level 3: For electronic transactions, the Applicant shall
    identify himself/herself in each new electronic transaction by
    presenting a temporary secret which was established during a prior
    transaction or encounter, or sent to the Applicant’s phone number,
    email address, or physical address of record. Permanent secrets
    shall only be issued to the Applicant within a protected session.

> For physical transactions, the Applicant shall identify
> himself/herself in person by either using a secret as described above,
> or through the use of a biometric that was recorded during a prior
> encounter. Temporary secrets shall not be reused. If the CSP issues
> permanent secrets during a physical transaction, then they shall be
> loaded locally onto a physical device that is issued in person to the
> Applicant or delivered in a manner that confirms the address of
> record.

-   At Level 4: Only physical transactions apply. The Applicant shall
    identify himself/herself in person in each new physical transaction
    through the use of a biometric that was recorded during a prior
    encounter.[^17] If the CSP issues permanent secrets, then they shall
    be loaded locally onto a physical device that is issued in person or
    delivered in a manner that confirms the address of record.

A common reason for breaking up the registration process as described
above is to allow the subscriber to register or obtain tokens for use in
two or more environments. This is permissible as long as the tokens
individually meet the appropriate assurance level. However, if the exact
number of tokens to be issued is not agreed upon early in the
registration process, then the tokens should be distinguishable so that
Verifiers will be able to detect whether any suspicious activity occurs
during the first few uses of a newly issued token.

If a valid credential has already been issued, the CSP may issue another
credential of equivalent or lower assurance. In this case, proof of
possession and control of the original token may be substituted for
repeating the identity proofing steps. (This is a special case of a
derived credential. See Section 5.3.5 for procedures when the derived
credential is issued by a different CSP.) Any requirements for
credential delivery at the appropriate Level shall still be satisfied.

Requirements for Educational and Financial Institutions and other Organizations  {#requirements-for-educational-and-financial-institutions-and-other-organizations .header3}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The relationships of many organizations (e.g., corporations, healthcare
organizations, educational institutions and financial institutions) to
the individuals who are employees, affiliates, associates, students and
customers are often regulated or supervised by government, while law and
regulation place burdens on these organizations to know the identities
of such individuals. The strength of these relationships and the
obligations of organizations to know identities vary considerably, for
example employers have legal obligations to withhold and pay taxes on
employees and are regulated by a variety of local, state and Federal
entities, but the certainty enforced in many employment situations is
not high. Retail stores are not broadly required to know their
customers, but financial institutions are. Healthcare organizations are
regulated at many levels and are expected to know the identities and
professional qualifications of their professional staff, as are legal
and accounting firms. This section identifies several areas where these
organizations may leverage their existing relationships with individuals
to act as CAs or CSPs for those individuals and issue credentials for
use with Federal entities.

At Level 2, employers and educational institutions who verify the
identity of their employees or students by means comparable to those
stated above for Level 2 may elect to become an RA or CSP and issue
credentials to employees or students, either in-person by inspection of
a corporate or school issued picture ID, or through online processes,
where notification is via the distribution channels normally used for
sensitive, personal communications.

Federal or State laws and regulations impose requirements for
institutions in certain businesses to confirm the educational and
licensing credentials for selected employees or affiliates. For example,
a health care organization that has accepted the Medicare "Conditions
for Participation" is required to examine the credentials for each
candidate for the medical staff. Where such institutions rigorously
confirm the identity, education, and licensing credentials of a licensed
professional through an in-person appearance before employment or
affiliation, this specification permits issuing e-authentication
credentials without repeating the identity proofing process.

The initial process for confirming the identity, education, and
licensing credentials of a licensed professional through an in-person
process must include the following steps:

-   Verification of a current primary Government Picture ID that
    contains Applicant’s picture, and either address of record or
    nationality of record (e.g., a driver’s license or passport);

-   Verification of post-secondary education/training of two or more
    years appropriate for the position (e.g., an appropriate medical
    degree); and

-   Verification of current state or federal licensure (e.g., as
    a physician) based on an examination process, with requirements for
    continuing education or active professional participation as a
    condition of valid licensing.

(Examples of licensed professionals that would generally be eligible for
streamlined credential issuance include medical doctors, registered
nurses, dentists, pharmacists, optometrists, veterinarians, lawyers, and
licensed professional engineers.)

Institutions that have performed a process satisfying these conditions
may issue e-authentication tokens and credentials to those employees and
affiliates with verified credentials at Levels 2, 3, or 4 provided that:

-   the issuance process is either:

1.  in-person, or

2.  for Levels 2 and 3, the remote issuance process incorporates the
    address/phone number confirmation appropriate for that level, and

-   they meet the corresponding provisions of Sections 6 through 9 for
    that Level.

Federal law, including the Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act,
imposes a duty on financial institutions to “know their customers” and
report suspicious transactions to help prevent money laundering and
terrorist financing. Many financial institutions are regulated by
Federal agencies such as the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
(OCC) or other members of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination
Council (FFIEC) and the Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC). These
regulators normally require the institutions to implement a Customer
Identification Program.

The following provisions apply to Federally regulated financial
institutions, brokerages and dealers subject to such Federal regulation,
that implement such a Customer Identification Program:

-   At Level 2, such institutions may issue credentials to their
    customers via the mechanisms normally used for online banking or
    brokerage credentials and may use online banking or brokerage
    credentials and tokens as Level 2 e-authentication credentials and
    tokens, provided they meet the provisions of Sections 6 through 9
    for Level 2.

-   At Level 3, such institutions may issue credentials to their
    customers via the mechanisms normally used for online banking or
    brokerage credentials and may use online banking or brokerage
    credentials and tokens as Level 3 e-authentication credentials and
    tokens, provided:

1.  The customers have been in good standing with the institution for a
    period of at least 1 year prior to the issuance of e-authentication
    credentials, and

2.  The credentials and tokens meet the provisions of Sections 6 through
    9 for Level 3.

-   At Level 4, such institutions may issue credentials to their
    customers via the mechanisms normally used for online banking or
    brokerage credentials and may use online banking or brokerage
    credentials and tokens as Level 4 e-authentication credentials,
    provided:

1.  The customers have appeared in-person before a representative of the
    financial institution, and the representative has inspected a
    Government issued primary Photo-ID and compared the picture to the
    customer; and

2.  The credentials and tokens meet all additional provisions of Section
    5, as well as all provisions in Sections 6 through 9 for Level 4,
    as appropriate.

        ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The identity proofing and certificate issuance processes specified in
the Federal PKI Certificate Policies \[FBCA1, FBCA2, FBCA3\] are
considered equivalent to the requirements specified in Section 5.3.1 in
accordance with [Appendix B](#_Appendix_B:_Mapping_of Federal PKI ).

At Level 2, agencies may rely on any CA whose policy satisfies the
identity proofing and registration requirements specified for Level 2,
in addition to any CA cross-certified with the Federal Bridge CA under
one of the certificate policies identified in Appendix B as a Level 2
certificate or a policy mapped to one of those policies through
cross-certificates. For Levels 3 and 4, agencies shall only accept PKI
certificates issued by a CA cross-certified with the Federal Bridge CA
under one of the certificate policies identified in Appendix B as a
Level 3 or Level 4 certificate or a policy mapped to one of those
policies through cross-certificates.

The identity proofing and certificate issuance processes specified in
Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 201, ‘Personal Identity
Verification’ \[FIPS201\], meet and exceed the Level 4 requirements
specified in the preceding section.

Requirements for One-Time Use {#requirements-for-one-time-use .header3}
-----------------------------

For infrequently used applications, issuance and maintenance of
credentials would be prohibitively expensive. Claimants can be
authenticated for immediate one-time access to an application for Levels
1 through 3. At Level 1, there is no requirement for identity proofing
before one-time use. At Levels 2 and 3, application owners act as the
RA/CSP in the remote registration processes described in Section 5.3.1,
using processes that do not require confirmation of the address of
record and omitting credential issuance.

For immediate one-time access at Level 2, application owners can use the
registration processes specified in Table 3 that:

-   Confirm "the ability of the Applicant to receive telephone
    communications or text message at phone number or e-mail address
    associated with the Applicant in records”; or

-   Subsequently send a “notice to an address of record confirmed in the
    records check.”

For immediate one-time access at Level 3, application owners can use the
registration process specified in Table 3 that:

-   Confirms "the ability of the Applicant to receive telephone
    communications at a phone number associated with the Applicant in
    records while recording the Applicant’s voice or using alternative
    means that establish an equivalent level of non-repudiation.”

        -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Where the Applicant already possesses recognized authentication
credentials, the CSP may choose to identity proof the Claimant by
verifying possession and control of the token associated with the
credentials and issue a new derived credential.

Before issuing any derived credential the CSP shall verify the original
credential status and shall verify that the corresponding token is
possessed and controlled by the Claimant. The status of the original
credential should be re-checked at a later date (e.g. after a week) to
confirm that it was not compromised at the time of issuance of the
derived credential. (This guards against the case where an Attacker
requests the desired credential before revocation information can be
updated.) Further, the CSP shall record the details of the original
credential used as the basis for derived credential issuance. If the
derived credential is revoked, the CSP that issued the derived
credential may notify the issuer of the original credential, if the
reason for revocation might motivate action by the issuer of the
original credential and applicable law, regulation, and agreements
permit such notification.

The CSP may issue a derived level 4 credential for a suitable Level 4
capable token, based on an original level 4 credential. Before issuing
the derived Level 4 credential, the CSP shall:

-   Obtain and verify a copy of a biometric recorded when the original
    credential was issued. An example of such a biometric is the signed
    biometric data object on a PIV card, however if the biometric
    reference is not available from the Level 4 token, it may be
    obtained elsewhere, as long as its authenticity is assured;

-   Compare a fresh biometric sample obtained in person from the
    Applicant to the reference biometric retained from the original
    Level 4 credentials and determine that they match, and;

-   Determine that the token that contains the token secret associated
    with the derived credential meets the requirements of Table 6 for a
    Level 4 token.

The CSP may issue a Level 3 derived credential based on proof of
possession of a Level 4 token. Issuance may be in person or remote. If
Level 3 credentials are electronically transmitted, or physically
shipped with a token to a claimant, then token activation shall require
proof of possession of both the derived token and the original Level 4
token.

The CSP may issue a Level 2 derived credential based on proof of
possession of a Level 3 or 4 token. Issuance may be in person or remote.
If Level 2 credentials are electronically transmitted, or physically
shipped with a token to a claimant, then token activation shall require
proof of possession of both the derived token and the original Level 3
or Level 4 token.

In some cases, there may be a desire to tightly couple the revocation
status of the derived credential to the original. In this case, it is
the responsibility of the CSP that issued the derived credential to
ensure that a tight coupling is maintained. For example, the issuer of
the derived credential could regularly monitor the status of the primary
credential.[^18] [^19]

====================================================================================================

The concept of a token was introduced in Section 4. This section
provides a more in-depth treatment of e-authentication tokens. Section
6.1 describes classes of tokens recognized by this recommendation and
how they can be combined in practice. Section 6.2 identifies threats and
mitigation strategies applicable to tokens. Section 6.3 maps recognized
classes of tokens to assurance levels and identifies any required threat
mitigation strategies.

 <span id="_Ref307830394" class="anchor"><span id="_Ref307838396" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc237074450" class="anchor"></span></span></span>Overview
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the e-authentication context, a token contains a secret to be used in
authentication processes. Tokens are possessed by a Claimant and
controlled through one or more of the traditional authentication factors
(*something you know*, *have*, or *are*). Figure 2 depicts an abstract
model for a token.

The outer box shown in Figure 2 is the token. Tokens may exist in
hardware (e.g., a smart card), software (e.g., a software cryptographic
module), or may only exist in human memory. The inner box represents the
token secret that is stored within the token. The output of a token is
the *token* *authenticator*, which is the value that is provided to the
protocol stack for transmission to the Verifier to prove that the
Claimant possesses and controls the token. The token authenticator may
be the token secret, or a transformation of the token secret.

There are two optional inputs to the token: *token input data*; and
*token activation data.* Token input data, such as a challenge or nonce,
may be required to generate the token authenticator. Token input data
may be supplied by the user or be a feature of the token itself (e.g.
the clock in an OTP device). Token activation data, such as a PIN or
biometric, may be required to activate the token and permit generation
of an authenticator. Token activation data is needed when a Claimant
controls the token through *something you know* or *something you are*.
(Where the token is something you know, such as a password or memorized
secret, token activation is implicit.)

The *authenticator* is generated through the use of the token. In the
general case, an authenticator is generated by performing a mathematical
function using the token secret and one or more optional token input
values (a nonce or challenge):

*Authenticator = Function (&lt;token secret&gt; \[, &lt;nonce&gt;\] \[,
&lt;challenge&gt;\] )*

As noted above, in the trivial case, the authenticator may be the token
secret itself (e.g., where the token is a password).

Single-factor versus Multi-factor Tokens {#single-factor-versus-multi-factor-tokens .header3}
----------------------------------------

Tokens are characterized by the number and types of authentication
factors that they use. (See Section 4.3 for discussion on three types of
authentication factors.) For example, a password is something you know,
a biometric is something you are, and a cryptographic identification
device is something you have. Tokens may be single-factor or
multi-factor tokens as described below:

-   *Single-factor Token* – A token that uses one of the three factors
    to achieve authentication. For example, a password is *something you
    know*. There are no additional factors required to activate the
    token, so this is considered single factor.

-   *Multi-factor Token* – A token that uses two or more factors to
    achieve authentication. For example, a private key on a smart card
    that is activated via PIN is a multi-factor token. The smart card is
    *something you have*, and *something you know* (the PIN) is required
    to activate the token.

This document does not differentiate between tokens that require two
factors and three factors, as two factors are sufficient to achieve the
highest level recognized in this document. Other applications or
environments may require such a differentiation.

Token Types {#token-types .header3}
-----------

These guidelines recognize the following types of tokens for
e-authentication.

-   *Memorized Secret Token* – A secret shared between the Subscriber
    and the CSP. Memorized Secret Tokens are typically character strings
    (e.g., passwords and passphrases) or numerical strings (e.g., PINs.)
    The token authenticator presented to the Verifier in an
    authentication process is the secret itself (e.g. the password or
    passphrase itself). Memorized secret tokens are *something you
    know*.

-   *Pre-registered Knowledge Token* – A series of responses to a set of
    prompts or challenges. These responses may be thought of as a set of
    shared secrets. The set of prompts and responses are established by
    the Subscriber and CSP during the registration process. The token
    authenticator is the set of memorized responses to pre-registered
    prompts during a single run of the authentication process. An
    example of a Pre-registered Knowledge Token would be establishing
    responses for prompts such as “What was your first pet’s name?”
    During the authentication process, the Claimant is asked to provide
    the appropriate responses to a subset of the prompts. Alternatively,
    a Subscriber might select and memorize an image during the
    registration process. In an authentication process, the Claimant is
    prompted to identify the correct images from a set(s) of
    similar images. Transactions from previously authenticated sessions
    could be accepted as Pre-registered Knowledge Tokens. Pre-registered
    Knowledge Tokens are *something you know*.

-   *Look-up Secret Token* – A physical or electronic token that stores
    a set of secrets shared between the Claimant and the CSP. The
    Claimant uses the token to look up the appropriate secret(s) needed
    to respond to a prompt from the Verifier (the token input). For
    example, a Claimant may be asked by the Verifier to provide a
    specific subset of the numeric or character strings printed on a
    card in table format. The token authenticator is the secret(s)
    identified by the prompt. Look-up secret tokens are *something you
    have*.

-   *Out of Band Token* – A physical token that is uniquely addressable
    and can receive a Verifier-selected secret for one-time use. The
    device is possessed and controlled by the Claimant and supports
    private communication[^20] over a channel that is separate from the
    primary channel for e-authentication. The token authenticator is the
    received secret and is presented to the Verifier using the primary
    channel for e-authentication. For example, a Claimant attempts to
    log into a website and receives a text message on his or her
    cellular phone, PDA, pager, or land line (pre-registered with the
    CSP during the registration phase) with a random authenticator to be
    presented as a part of the electronic authentication protocol. Out
    of Band Tokens are *something you have*.

-   *Single-factor (SF) One-Time Password (OTP) Device* – A hardware
    device that supports the spontaneous generation of
    one-time passwords. This device has an embedded secret that is used
    as the seed for generation of one-time passwords and does not
    require activation through a second factor. Authentication is
    accomplished by providing an acceptable one-time password and
    thereby proving possession and control of the device. The token
    authenticator is the one-time password. For example, a one-time
    password device may display 6 characters at a time. SF OTP devices
    are *something you have*.

-   *Single-factor (SF) Cryptographic Device* – a hardware device that
    performs cryptographic operations on input provided to the device.
    This device does not require activation through a second factor
    of authentication. This device uses embedded symmetric or asymmetric
    cryptographic keys. Authentication is accomplished by proving
    possession of the device. The token authenticator is highly
    dependent on the specific cryptographic device and protocol, but it
    is generally some type of signed message. For example, in TLS, there
    is a “certificate verify” message. SF Cryptographic Devices are
    *something you have*.

-   *Multi-factor (MF) Software Cryptographic Token* – A cryptographic
    key is stored on disk or some other “soft” media and requires
    activation through a second factor of authentication. Authentication
    is accomplished by proving possession and control of the key. The
    token authenticator is highly dependent on the specific
    cryptographic protocol, but it is generally some type of
    signed message. For example, in TLS, there is a “certificate
    verify” message. The MF software cryptographic token is *something
    you have*, and it may be activated by either *something you know* or
    *something you are*.

-   *Multi-factor (MF) One-Time Password (OTP) Device* – A hardware
    device that generates one-time passwords for use in authentication
    and which requires activation through a second factor
    of authentication. The second factor of authentication may be
    achieved through some kind of integral entry pad, an integral
    biometric (e.g., fingerprint) reader or a direct computer interface
    (e.g., USB port). The one-time password is typically displayed on
    the device and manually input to the Verifier as a password,
    although direct electronic input from the device to a computer is
    also allowed. The token authenticator is the one-time password. For
    example, a one-time password device may display 6 characters at
    a time. The MF OTP device is *something you have*, and it may be
    activated by either *something you know* or *something you are*.

-   *Multi-factor (MF) Cryptographic Device* – A hardware device that
    contains a protected cryptographic key that requires activation
    through a second authentication factor. Authentication is
    accomplished by proving possession of the device and control of
    the key. The token authenticator is highly dependent on the specific
    cryptographic device and protocol, but it is generally some type of
    signed message. For example, in TLS, there is a “certificate
    verify” message. The MF Cryptographic device is *something you
    have*, and it may be activated by either *something you know* or
    *something you are*.

    1.  Token Usage {#token-usage .header3}
        -----------

An authentication process may involve a single token, or a combination
of two or more tokens, as described below.

-   *Single-token authentication* – The Claimant presents a single token
    authenticator to prove his or her identity to the Verifier. For
    example, when a Claimant attempts to log into a password protected
    website, the Claimant enters a username and password. In this
    instance, only the password would be considered to be a token.

-   *Multi-token authentication* – The Claimant presents token
    authenticators generated by two or more tokens to prove his or her
    identity to the Verifier. The combination of tokens is characterized
    by the combination of factors used by the tokens (both inherent in
    the manifestation of the tokens, and those used to activate
    the tokens). A Verifier that requires a Claimant to enter a password
    and use a single-factor cryptographic device is an example of
    multi-token authentication. The combination is considered
    multi-factor, since the password is *something you know* and the
    cryptographic device is *something you have.*

    1.  Multi-Stage Authentication Using Tokens {#multi-stage-authentication-using-tokens .header3}
        ---------------------------------------

Multi-stage authentication processes, which use a single-factor token to
obtain a second token, do not constitute multi-factor authentication.
The level of assurance associated with the compound solution is the
assurance level of the weakest token.

For example, some cryptographic mobility solutions allow full or partial
cryptographic keys to be stored on an online server and downloaded to
the Claimant’s local system after successful authentication using a
password or passphrase. Subsequently, the Claimant can use the
downloaded software cryptographic token to authenticate to a remote
Verifier for e-authentication. This type of solution is considered only
as strong as the password provided by the Claimant to obtain the
cryptographic token.

Assurance Level Escalation {#assurance-level-escalation .header3}
--------------------------

In certain circumstances, it may be desirable to raise the assurance
level of an e-authentication session between a Subscriber and an RP in
the middle of the application session. This guideline recognizes a
special case of multi-token authentication, where a primary token is
used to establish a secure session, and a secondary token is used later
in the session to present a second token authenticator. Even though the
two tokens were not used at the same time, this document recognizes the
result as a multi-token authentication scheme (which may upgrade the
overall level of assurance). In these authentication scenarios, the
level of assurance achieved by the two stages in combination is the same
as a multi-token authentication scheme using the same set of tokens.
Table 7 describes the highest level of assurance achievable through a
combination of two token types.

<span id="_Ref302663818" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc237074456" class="anchor"></span></span>Token Threats
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An Attacker who can gain control of a token will be able to masquerade
as the token’s owner. Threats to tokens can be categorized based on
attacks on the types of authentication factors that comprise the token:

-   *Something you have* may be lost, damaged, stolen from the owner or
    cloned by the Attacker. For example, an Attacker who gains access to
    the owner’s computer might copy a software token. A hardware token
    might be stolen, tampered with, or duplicated.

-   *Something you know* may be disclosed to an Attacker. The Attacker
    might guess a password or PIN. Where the token is a shared secret,
    the Attacker could gain access to the CSP or Verifier and obtain the
    secret value. An Attacker may observe the entry of a PIN or
    passcode, find a written record or journal entry of a PIN or
    passcode, or may install malicious software (e.g., a
    keyboard logger) to capture the secret. Additionally, an Attacker
    may determine the secret through off-line attacks on network traffic
    from an authentication attempt. Finally, an Attacker may be able to
    gain information about a Subscriber’s Pre-registered Knowledge
    researching the subscriber or through other social
    engineering techniques. (For example, the subscriber might refer to
    his or her first pet in a conversation or blog.)

-   *Something you are* may be replicated. An Attacker may obtain a copy
    of the token owner’s fingerprint and construct a replica - assuming
    that the biometric system(s) employed do not block such attacks by
    employing robust liveness detection techniques

This document assumes that the Subscriber is not colluding with the
Attacker who is attempting to falsely authenticate to the Verifier. With
this assumption in mind, the threats to the token(s) used for
e-authentication are listed in Table 4, along with some examples.

  Theft                       A physical token is stolen by an Attacker.                                                                                                    A hardware cryptographic device is stolen.
                                                                                                                                                                            A One-Time Password device is stolen.
                                                                                                                                                                            A look-up secret token is stolen.
                                                                                                                                                                            A cell phone is stolen.
  Discovery                   The responses to token prompts are easily discovered through searching various data sources.                                                  The question “What high school did you attend?” is asked as a Pre-registered Knowledge Token, when the answer is commonly found on social media websites.
  Duplication                 The Subscriber’s token has been copied with or without his or her knowledge.                                                                  Passwords written on paper are disclosed.
                                                                                                                                                                            Passwords stored in an electronic file are copied.
                                                                                                                                                                            Software PKI token (private key) copied.
                                                                                                                                                                            Look-up token copied.
  Eavesdropping               The token secret or authenticator is revealed to the Attacker as the Subscriber is submitting the token to send over the network.             Passwords are learned by watching keyboard entry.
                                                                                                                                                                            Passwords are learned by keystroke logging software.
                                                                                                                                                                            A PIN is captured from PIN pad device.
  Offline cracking            The token is exposed using analytical methods outside the authentication mechanism.                                                           A key is extracted by differential power analysis on stolen hardware cryptographic token.
                                                                                                                                                                            A software PKI token is subjected to dictionary attack to identify the correct password to use to decrypt the private key.
  Phishing or pharming        The token secret or authenticator is captured by fooling the Subscriber into thinking the Attacker is a Verifier or RP.                       A password is revealed by Subscriber to a website impersonating the Verifier.
                                                                                                                                                                            A password is revealed by a bank Subscriber in response to an email inquiry from a Phisher pretending to represent the bank.
                                                                                                                                                                            A password is revealed by the Subscriber at a bogus Verifier website reached through DNS re-routing.
  Social engineering          The Attacker establishes a level of trust with a Subscriber in order to convince the Subscriber to reveal his or her token or token secret.   A password is revealed by the Subscriber to an officemate asking for the password on behalf of the Subscriber’s boss.
                                                                                                                                                                            A password is revealed by a Subscriber in a telephone inquiry from an Attacker masquerading as a system administrator.
  Online guessing             The Attacker connects to the Verifier online and attempts to guess a valid token authenticator in the context of that Verifier.               Online dictionary attacks are used to guess passwords.
                                                                                                                                                                            Online guessing is used to guess token authenticators for a one-time password token registered to a legitimate Claimant.

Threat Mitigation Strategies {#threat-mitigation-strategies-1 .header3}
----------------------------

Token related mechanisms that assist in mitigating the threats
identified above are summarized in Table 5.

<span id="_Ref296983185" class="anchor"></span>Table - Mitigating Token
Threats

  ------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Token Threat/Attack**   **Threat Mitigation Mechanisms**

  Theft                     - Use multi-factor tokens which need to be activated through a PIN or biometric.

  Duplication               - Use tokens that are difficult to duplicate, such as hardware cryptographic tokens.

  Discovery                 - Use methods in which the responses to prompts cannot be easily discovered.

  Eavesdropping             - Use tokens with dynamic authenticators where knowledge of one authenticator does not assist in deriving a subsequent authenticator.
                            
                            - Use tokens that generate authenticators based on a token input value.
                            
                            - Establish tokens through a separate channel.

  Offline cracking          - Use a token with a high entropy token secret
                            
                            - Use a token that locks up after a number of repeated failed activation attempts.

  Phishing or pharming      - Use tokens with dynamic authenticators where knowledge of one authenticator does not assist in deriving a subsequent authenticator.

  Social engineering        - Use tokens with dynamic authenticators where knowledge of one authenticator does not assist in deriving a subsequent authenticator.

  Online guessing           - Use tokens that generate high entropy authenticators.
  ------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are several other strategies that may be applied to mitigate the
threats described in Table 5:

-   *Multiple factors* make successful attacks more difficult
    to accomplish. If an Attacker needs to steal a cryptographic token
    and guess a password, then the work to discover both factors may be
    too high.

-   *Physical security mechanisms* may be employed to protect a stolen
    token from duplication. Physical security mechanisms can provide
    tamper evidence, detection, and response.

-   *Imposing password complexity rules* may reduce the likelihood of a
    successful guessing attack. Requiring the use of long passwords that
    don’t appear in common dictionaries may force Attackers to try every
    possible password.

-   *System and network security controls* may be employed to prevent an
    Attacker from gaining access to a system or installing
    malicious software.

-   *Periodic training* may be performed to ensure the Subscriber
    understands when and how to report compromise (or suspicion
    of compromise) or otherwise recognize patterns of behavior that may
    signify an Attacker attempting to compromise the token.

-   *Out of band techniques* may be employed to verify proof of
    possession of registered devices (e.g., cell phones).

        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section discusses the requirements for tokens used at various
levels of assurance.

The following sections list token requirements for single and
multi-token authentication.

#### Single Token Authentication

Table 6 lists the assurance levels that may be achieved by each of the
token types when used in a single-token authentication scheme. The
requirements for each token are listed per assurance level. If token
requirements are listed only at one assurance level, the token may be
used at lower levels but shall satisfy the requirements given at
whatever level is listed. If there is more than one box under “Verifier
Requirements” for a given token type, it is only necessary to satisfy
the requirements in one box.

The principles used in generating Table 7 are as follows. Level 3 can be
achieved using two tokens rated at Level 2 that represent two different
factors of authentication. Since this specification does not address the
use of biometrics as a stand-alone token for remote authentication,
achieving Level 3 with separate Level 2 tokens implies *something you
have* and *something you know*:

Token (Level 2, *something you have*) + Token (Level 2, *something you
know*) → Token(Level 3)

In all other cases, combinations of tokens are considered to achieve the
Level of the highest rated token.

For example, a Memorized Secret Token combined with a Look-up Secret
Token can be used to achieve Level 3 authentication, since the look-up
secret token is “something you have” and the Memorized Secret Token is
“something you know”. However, combining a MF software cryptographic
token (which is rated at Level 3) and a Memorized Secret Token (which is
rated at Level 2) achieves an overall level of 3, since the addition of
the Memorized Secret Token does not increase the assurance of the
combination.

It should be noted that to achieve Level 4 with a single token or token
combination, one of the tokens needs to be usable with an authentication
process that strongly resists man-in-the-middle attacks. While it is
possible to meet this requirement with a wide variety of token types,
certain choices of tokens may complicate the task of designing a
protocol that meets Level 4 requirements for authentication process (as
described in Section 8 of this document). In particular, one-time
password devices that rely exclusively on the human user for input and
output may be especially problematic and may need to be supplemented
with a software cryptographic token to provide strong man-in-the-middle
resistance.

        ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As introduced in Section 4, credentials are objects that bind identity
to a token. To maintain the level of assurance provided by an
e-authentication solution, credentials and tokens shall be managed to
reflect any changes in that binding. This section discusses token and
credential management activities performed by the CSP subsequent to the
registration, identity proofing and issuance activities described in
Section 5. This includes the lifecycle management activities for the
token and credential. The activities that must be performed by the CSP
depend in part upon the nature of the credentials and the token itself.

<span id="_Ref303441554" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc237074462" class="anchor"></span></span>Categorizing Credentials {#categorizing-credentials .header3}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This specification categorizes credentials according to two orthogonal
perspectives. Some classes of credentials can be distributed to relying
parties, while others cannot be disclosed by the CSP without
compromising the token itself. Another classification indicates whether
the binding represented in the credential is tamper-evident.

Credentials that describe the binding in a way that does not compromise
the token are referred to as *Public Credentials*. The classic example
of a Public Credential is a public key certificate; it is mathematically
infeasible to calculate the user’s private key even with knowledge of
the corresponding public key. Credentials that cannot be disclosed by
the CSP because the contents can be used to compromise the token are
considered *Private Credentials*. The classic example of a Private
Credential is the hashed value of a password, since this hash can be
used to perform an offline attack on the password.

Credentials that describe the binding between a user and token in a
tamper-evident fashion are considered *Strongly Bound Credentials*. For
example, modification of a digitally signed credential (such as a public
key certificate) can be easily detected through signature verification.
The binding between a user and token can be modified in *Weakly Bound
Credentials* without invalidating the credentials. Weakly bound
credentials require supplemental integrity protection and/or access
controls to ensure that the binding represented by the credential
remains accurate. For example, replacing the value of a hashed password
in a password file associates the user with a new password, so access to
this file is restricted to system users and processes.

Strongly bound credential mechanisms require little or no additional
integrity protection, whereas weakly bound credentials require
additional integrity protection or access controls to ensure that
unauthorized parties cannot spoof or tamper with the binding of the
identity to the token representation within the credential.

Unencrypted password files are private credentials that are weakly
bound, and hence need to be afforded confidentiality as well as
integrity protection. Signed password files are private credentials that
are strongly bound and therefore require confidentiality protection but
no additional integrity protection. An unsigned pairing of a public key
and the name of its owner or a self-signed certificate is an example of
a public credential that is weakly bound. Finally, a CA-signed public
key certificate represents a public credential that is strongly bound.

CSPs and Verifiers are trusted to obey the requirements in this section
as well as Section 8.

Token and Credential Management Activities  {#token-and-credential-management-activities .header3}
-------------------------------------------

The CSP manages tokens and credentials. The RA establishes the
Applicant’s identity, and the CSP is responsible for generating
credentials and supplying the Subscriber with a token or allowing the
Subscriber to register his or her own token as described in Section 5.
The CSP is responsible for some or all of the following token and
credential management activities following issuance of the token and
credential:

-   *Credential storage* – After the credential has been created, the
    CSP may be responsible for maintaining the credentials in storage.
    In cases where the credentials are stored by the CSP, the level of
    security afforded to the credential will depend on the type of
    credential issued. For private credentials, additional
    confidentiality mechanisms are required in storage, whereas for
    public credentials, this is not necessary. Similarly, for weakly
    bound credentials, additional integrity protection is needed in
    storage, unlike strongly bound credentials. Finally, credentials
    need to be available to allow CSPs and Verifiers to determine the
    identity of the corresponding token owner.

-   *Token and credential verification services* – In many
    e-authentication scenarios, the Verifier and the CSP are not part of
    the same entity. In these cases, the CSP is responsible for
    providing the Verifier with the information needed to facilitate the
    token and credential verification process. The CSP may provide token
    and credential verification services to Verifiers. For example, the
    Verifier may request the CSP to verify the password submitted by the
    Claimant against the CSP’s local password database.

-   *Token and credential renewal /re-issuance* – Certain types of
    tokens and credentials may support the process of renewal
    or re-issuance. During renewal, the usage or validity period of the
    token and credential is extended without changing the Subscriber’s
    identity or token. During re-issuance, a new credential is created
    for a Subscriber with a new identity and/or a new token.

> The CSP establishes suitable policies for renewal and re-issuance of
> tokens and credentials. The CSP may establish a time period prior to
> the expiration of the credential, when the Subscriber can request
> renewal or re-issuance following successful authentication using his
> or her existing, unexpired token and credential. For example, a CSP
> may allow a digital certificate to be renewed for another year prior
> to the expiry of the current certificate by proving possession and
> control of the existing token (i.e., the private key).
>
> Once the Subscriber’s credentials have expired, the Subscriber may be
> required to re-establish his or her identity with the CSP; this is
> typically the case with CSPs that issue digital certificates.
> Conversely, the CSP may establish a grace period for the renewal or
> re-issuance of an expired credential, such that the Subscriber can
> request renewal/re-issuance of his or her credential even after it has
> expired without the need to re-establish his or her identity with the
> CSP. For example, if a Claimant attempts to login to a
> username/password based system on which his or her password has
> already expired, and the system supports a grace period, the user may
> be prompted to create a new password and supply the last password for
> verification purposes. The use of expired tokens or credentials to
> invoke renewal/re-issuance is more practical when the Verifier and CSP
> are part of the same entity.
>
> The public key certificate for a Subscriber may be renewed with the
> same public key, or may be re-issued with a new public key. Passwords
> are seldom renewed so that the life of the existing password is
> extended for another period. Usually the account name/password
> credential for a Subscriber is renewed by having the Subscriber select
> a new password.

-   *Token and credential revocation and destruction* – The CSP is
    responsible for maintaining the revocation status of credentials and
    destroying the credential at the end of its life. Explicit and
    elaborate revocation mechanisms may be required for “public
    credentials” since these credentials are disseminated widely,
    possibly with a preset validity period. For example, public key
    certificates are revoked using Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)
    after the certificates are distributed.

> “Private credentials” are held closely by the CSP, and hence the
> revocation and destruction of these credentials is implemented easily
> through an update of the CSP’s local credential stores. Credentials
> that bind usernames/passwords are instantaneously revoked and
> destroyed if the CSP deletes its mapping between the username and the
> password. Certain types of tokens may need to be explicitly deleted or
> zeroized at the end of the credential life in order to permanently
> disable the token and prevent its unauthorized reuse. For example, a
> Multi-factor Hardware Cryptographic Token may need to be zeroized to
> ensure that all of the information pertaining to the Subscriber is
> deleted from the token.
>
> The CSP may be responsible for ensuring that hardware tokens are
> collected and cleared of any data when the Subscriber no longer has a
> need for its use. The CSP may establish policies for token collection
> to avoid the possibility of unauthorized use of the token after it is
> considered out of use. The CSP may destroy such collected tokens, or
> zeroize them to ensure that there are no remnants of information that
> can be used by an Attacker to derive the token value. For example, a
> Subscriber who is issued a hardware OTP token by a CSP may be required
> by policy to return the token to the CSP at the end of its life, or
> when the Subscriber’s association with that CSP terminates.

-   *Records retention* – The CSP or its representative is responsible
    for maintaining a record of the registration, history, and status of
    each token and credential, including revocation. CSPs operated by or
    on behalf of executive branch agencies shall also follow either the
    General Records Schedule established by the National Archives and
    Records Administration or an agency-specific schedule as applicable.
    All other entities shall comply with their respective records
    retention policies in accordance with whatever laws apply to
    those entities. A minimum record retention period is required at
    Level 2 and above.

-   *Security controls* – The CSP is responsible for implementing and
    maintaining appropriate security controls contained in NIST
    SP 800-53. The security control baseline for CSPs is specified in
    terms of a FIPS 200 impact level for each assurance level. (See
    Section 7.3, below.)

    1.  <span id="_Toc235722054" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc237074464" class="anchor"></span></span>Token and Credential Management Threats
        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tokens and credentials can only be as strong as the strength of the
management mechanisms used to secure them. The CSP is responsible for
mitigating threats to the management operations described in the last
section. Token and credential management threats are described below;
they are categorized in accordance with the management activity to which
they apply.

These threats represent the potential to breach the confidentiality,
integrity and availability of tokens and credentials during the CSP
activities, and are listed below.

  Token and credential issuance/renewal/re-issuance   Disclosure                                      Password renewed by the CSP for a Subscriber is copied by an Attacker as it is transported from the CSP to the Subscriber.

                                                                                                      Attacker is able to take advantage of a weak credential renewal protocol to extend the credential validity period for a current Subscriber.

  --------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Level 1

At Level 1, the following shall be required:

-   *Credential storage* – Files of shared secrets used by Verifiers at
    Level 1 authentication shall be protected by access controls that
    limit access to administrators and only to those applications that
    require access. Such shared secret files shall not contain the
    plaintext passwords; typically they contain a one-way hash or
    “inversion” of the password. In addition, any method allowed for the
    protection of long-term shared secrets at Level 2 or above may be
    used at Level 1.

-   *Token and credential verification services* – Long term token
    secrets should not be shared with other parties unless
    absolutely necessary.

-   *Token and credential renewal / re-issuance* – No stipulation

-   *Token and credential revocation and destruction* – No stipulation

-   *Records retention* – No stipulation

-   *Security controls* – No stipulation

    1.  #### Level 2

At Level 2, the following shall be required:

-   *Credential storage* – Files of shared secrets used by CSPs at Level
    2 shall be protected by access controls that limit access to
    administrators and only to those applications that require access.
    Such shared secret files shall not contain the plaintext passwords
    or secrets; two alternative methods may be used to protect the
    shared secret:

    1.  Passwords may be concatenated to a variable salt (variable
        across a group of passwords that are stored together) and then
        hashed with an Approved algorithm so that the computations used
        to conduct a dictionary or exhaustion attack on a stolen
        password file are not useful to attack other similar
        password files. The hashed passwords are then stored in the
        password file. The variable salt may be composed using a global
        salt (common to a group of passwords) and the username (unique
        per password) or some other technique to ensure uniqueness of
        the salt within the group of passwords.

    2.  Shared secrets may be encrypted and stored using Approved
        encryption algorithms and modes, and the needed secret decrypted
        only when immediately required for authentication. In addition,
        any method allowed to protect shared secrets at Level 3 or 4 may
        be used at Level 2.

-   *Token and credential verification services* – Long term shared
    authentication secrets, if used, shall never be revealed to any
    other party except Verifiers operated by the CSP; however,
    session (temporary) shared secrets may be provided by the CSP to
    independent Verifiers.

> Cryptographic protections are required for all messages between the
> CSP and Verifier which contain private credentials or assert the
> validity of weakly bound or potentially revoked credentials. Private
> credentials shall only be sent through a protected session to an
> authenticated party to ensure confidentiality and tamper protection.
>
> The CSP may send the Verifier a message that either asserts that a
> weakly bound credential is valid, or that a strongly bound credential
> has not been subsequently revoked. In this case, the message shall be
> logically bound to the credential, and the message, the logical
> binding, and the credential shall all be transmitted within a single
> integrity protected session between the Verifier and the authenticated
> CSP. If revocation is an issue, the integrity protected messages shall
> either be time stamped, or the session keys shall expire with an
> expiration time no longer than that of the revocation list.
> Alternatively, the time stamped message, binding, and credential may
> all be signed by the CSP, although, in this case, the three in
> combination would comprise a strongly bound credential with no need
> for revocation.

-   *Token and credential renewal/re-issuance* – The CSP shall establish
    suitable policies for renewal and re-issuance of tokens
    and credentials. Proof-of-possession of the unexpired current token
    shall be demonstrated by the Claimant prior to the CSP allowing
    renewal and re-issuance. Passwords shall not be renewed; they shall
    be re-issued. After expiry of current token and any grace period,
    renewal and re-issuance shall not be allowed. Upon re-issuance,
    token secrets shall not be set to a default or reused in any manner.
    All interactions shall occur over a protected session such
    as SSL/TLS.

-   *Token and credential revocation and destruction* – CSPs shall
    revoke or destroy credentials and tokens within 72 hours after being
    notified that a credential is no longer valid or a token is
    compromised to ensure that a Claimant using the token cannot
    successfully be authenticated. If the CSP issues credentials that
    expire automatically within 72 hours (e.g., issues fresh
    certificates with a 24 hour validity period each day) then the CSP
    is not required to provide an explicit mechanism to revoke
    the credentials. CSPs that register passwords shall ensure that the
    revocation or de-registration of the password can be accomplished in
    no more than 72 hours. CAs cross-certified with the Federal Bridge
    CA at the Citizen and Commerce Class Basic, Medium and High or
    Common Certificate Policy levels are considered to meet credential
    status and revocation provisions of this level.

-   *Records retention* – A record of the registration, history, and
    status of each token and credential (including revocation) shall be
    maintained by the CSP or its representative. The record retention
    period of data for Level 2 credentials is seven years and six months
    beyond the expiration or revocation (whichever is later) of
    the credential. CSPs operated by or on behalf of executive branch
    agencies shall also follow either the General Records Schedule
    established by the National Archives and Records Administration or
    an agency-specific schedule as applicable. All other entities shall
    comply with their respective records retention policies in
    accordance with whatever laws apply to those entities.

-   *Security controls* – The CSP must employ appropriately tailored
    security controls from the low baseline of security controls defined
    in \[[SP 800-53](#SP_800_53)\] and must ensure that the minimum
    assurance requirements associated with the low baseline
    are satisfied.

    1.  #### Level 3

At Level 3, the following is required:

-   *Credential storage*[^25] – Files of long-term shared secrets used
    by CSPs or Verifiers at Level 3 shall be protected by access
    controls that limit access to administrators and only to those
    applications that require access. Such shared secret files shall be
    encrypted so that:

1.  The encryption key for the shared secret file is encrypted under a
    key held in a FIPS 140-2 Level 2 or higher validated hardware
    cryptographic module or any FIPS 140-2 Level 3 or 4 cryptographic
    module and decrypted only as immediately required for an
    authentication operation.

2.  Shared secrets are protected as a key within the boundary of a FIPS
    140-2 Level 2 or higher validated hardware cryptographic module or
    any FIPS 140-2 Level 3 or 4 cryptographic module and is not exported
    in plaintext from the module.

> Strongly bound credentials support tamper detection mechanisms such as
> digital signatures, but weakly bound credentials can be protected
> against tampering using access control mechanisms as described above.

-   *Token and credential verification services* – CSPs shall provide a
    secure mechanism to allow Verifiers or RPs to ensure that the
    credentials are valid. Such mechanisms may include on-line
    validation servers or the involvement of CSP servers that have
    access to status records in authentication transactions.

> Temporary session authentication keys may be generated from long-term
> shared secret keys by CSPs and distributed to third party Verifiers,
> as a part of the verification services offered by the CSP, but
> long-term shared secrets shall not be shared with any third parties,
> including third party Verifiers. This type of third-party (or
> delegated) verification is used in the realm of GSM (Global System for
> Mobile Communications) roaming; the locally available network
> authenticates the “roaming” Subscriber using a temporary session
> authentication key received from the Base Station. Such temporary
> session authentication keys are typically created by cryptographically
> combining the long term shared secret with a nonce challenge, to
> generate a session key. The challenge and session key are securely
> transmitted to the Verifier. The Verifier in turn sends only the
> challenge to the Claimant, and the Claimant applies the challenge to
> the long-term shared secret to generate the session key. Both Claimant
> and Verifier now share a session key, which can be used for
> authentication. Such verification schemes are permitted at this level
> provided that Approved cryptographic algorithms are used for all
> operations.
>
> Token and credential verification services categorized as FIPS 199
> “Moderate” or “High” for availability shall be protected in accordance
> with the Contingency Planning (CP) controls specified in NIST SP
> 800-53 to provide an adequate level of availability needed for the
> service.

-   *Token and credential renewal /re-issuance* – Renewal and
    re-issuance shall only occur prior to expiration of the
    current credential. Claimants shall authenticate to the CSP using
    the existing token and credential in order to renew or re-issue
    the credential. All interactions shall occur over a protected
    session such as SSL/TLS.

-   *Credential revocation and destruction* – CSPs shall have a
    procedure to revoke credentials and tokens within 24 hours. The
    certificate status provisions of CAs cross-certified with the
    Federal Bridge CA at the Basic, Medium, High or Common Certificate
    Policy levels are considered to meet credential status and
    revocation provisions of this level. Verifiers shall ensure that the
    tokens they rely upon are either freshly issued (within 24 hours) or
    still valid. Shared secret based authentication systems may simply
    remove revoked Subscribers from the verification database.

-   *Records retention* – All stipulations from Level 2 apply.

-   *Security controls* – The CSP must employ appropriately tailored
    security controls from the moderate baseline of security controls
    defined in \[[SP 800-53](#SP_800_53)\] and must ensure that the
    minimum assurance requirements associated with the moderate baseline
    are satisfied.

    1.  #### Level 4

At Level 4, the following is required:

-   *Credential storage* – No additional stipulation.

-   *Token and credential verification services* – No
    additional stipulation.

-   *Token and credential renewal/re-issuance* – Sensitive data
    transfers shall be cryptographically authenticated using keys bound
    to the authentication process. All temporary or short-term keys
    derived during the original authentication operation shall expire
    and re-authentication shall be required after not more than 24 hours
    from the initial authentication.

-   *Token and credential revocation and destruction* – CSPs shall have
    a procedure to revoke credentials within 24 hours. Verifiers or RPs
    shall ensure that the credentials they rely upon are either freshly
    issued (within 24 hours) or still valid. The certificate status
    provisions of CAs cross-certified with the Federal Bridge CA at the
    High and Common Certificate Policies shall be considered to meet
    credential status provisions of Level 4.
    \[[FBCA1](#_Certificate_Policies)\]

> It is generally good practice to destroy a token within 48 hours of
> the end of its life or the end of the Subscriber’s association with
> the CSP. Destroying includes either the physical destruction of the
> token or cleansing it of all information related to the Subscriber.

-   *Records retention* – All stipulations from Levels 2 and 3 apply.
    The minimum record retention period for Level 4 credential data is
    ten years and six months beyond the expiration or revocation of
    the credential.

-   *Security controls* – The CSP must employ appropriately tailored
    security controls from the moderate baseline of security controls
    defined in \[[SP 800-53](#SP_800_53)\] and must ensure that the
    minimum assurance requirements associated with the moderate baseline
    are satisfied.

    1.  Overview
        --------

The authentication process establishes the identity of the Claimant to
the Verifier with a certain degree of assurance. It is implemented
through an authentication protocol message exchange, as well as
management mechanisms at each end that further constrain or secure the
authentication activity. One or more of the messages of the
authentication protocol may need to be carried on a protected session.
This is illustrated in Figure 3.

![](media/image5.png)

<span id="_Ref296982973" class="anchor"></span>Figure - *Authentication
Process Model*

*An authentication protocol is a defined sequence of messages between a
Claimant and a Verifier that demonstrates that the Claimant has control
of a valid token to establish his or her identity, and optionally,
demonstrates to the Claimant that he or she is communicating with the
intended Verifier*. An exchange of messages between a Claimant and a
Verifier that results in authentication (or authentication failure)
between the two parties is an authentication protocol run. During or
after a successful authentication protocol run, a protected
communication session may be created between the two parties; this
protected session may be used to exchange the remaining messages of the
authentication protocol run, or to exchange session data between the two
parties.

Management mechanisms may be implemented on the Claimant and the
Verifier to further enhance the authentication process. For example,
trust anchors may be established at the Claimant to enable the
authentication of the Verifier using public key mechanisms such as TLS.
Similarly, mechanisms may be implemented on the Verifier to limit the
rate of online guessing of passwords by an Attacker who is trying to
authenticate as a legitimate Claimant. Further, detection of
authentication transactions originating from an unexpected location or
channel for a Claimant, or indicating use of an unexpected hardware or
software configuration, may indicate increased risk levels and motivate
additional confirmation of the Claimant’s identity.

At the conclusion of the authentication protocol run, the verifier might
issue a secondary authentication credential, such as a cookie, to the
Claimant and rely upon it to authenticate the claimant in the near
future. Requirements for doing this securely are in Section 9.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In general, attacks that reveal long-term token secrets are worse than
attacks that reveal short-term authentication secrets or session data,
because in the former, the Attacker can then use the token secret to
assume a Subscriber’s identity and do greater harm.

RAs, CSPs, and Verifiers are ordinarily trustworthy (in the sense of
being correctly implemented and not deliberately malicious). However,
Claimants or their systems may not be trustworthy (or else their
identity claims could simply be trusted). Moreover, while RAs, CSPs, and
Verifiers are normally trustworthy, they are not invulnerable, and could
become corrupted. Therefore, authentication protocols that expose
long-term authentication secrets more than is absolutely required, even
to trusted entities, should be avoided. Table 10 lists the types of
threats posed to the authentication process.

  **Type of Attack**   **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             **Example**
  Online guessing      An Attacker performs repeated logon trials by guessing possible values of the token authenticator.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          An Attacker navigates to a web page and attempts to log in using a Subscriber's username and commonly used passwords, such as “password” and “secret”.
  Phishing             A Subscriber is lured to interact with a counterfeit Verifier, and tricked into revealing his or her token secret, sensitive personal data or authenticator values that can be used to masquerade as the Subscriber to the Verifier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        A Subscriber is sent an email that redirects him or her to a fraudulent website and is asked to log in using his or her username and password.
  Pharming             A Subscriber who is attempting to connect to a legitimate Verifier, is routed to an Attacker’s website through manipulation of the domain name service or routing tables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   A Subscriber is directed to a counterfeit website through DNS poisoning, and reveals or uses his or her token believing he or she is interacting with the legitimate Verifier.
  Eavesdropping        An Attacker listens passively to the authentication protocol to capture information which can be used in a subsequent active attack to masquerade as the Claimant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          An Attacker captures the transmission of a password or password hash from a Claimant to a Verifier.
  Replay               An Attacker is able to replay previously captured messages (between a legitimate Claimant and a Verifier) to authenticate as that Claimant to the Verifier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 An Attacker captures a Claimant’s password or password hash from an actual authentication session, and replays it to the Verifier to gain access at a later time.
  Session hijack       An Attacker is able to insert himself or herself between a Subscriber and a Verifier subsequent to a successful authentication exchange between the latter two parties. The Attacker is able to pose as a Subscriber to the Verifier/RP or vice versa to control session data exchange.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     An Attacker is able to take over an already authenticated session by eavesdropping on or predicting the value of authentication cookies used to mark HTTP requests sent by the Subscriber.
  Man-in-the-middle    The Attacker positions himself or herself in between the Claimant and Verifier so that he or she can intercept and alter the content of the authentication protocol messages. The Attacker typically impersonates the Verifier to the Claimant and simultaneously impersonates the Claimant to the Verifier. Conducting an active exchange with both parties simultaneously may allow the Attacker to use authentication messages sent by one legitimate party to successfully authenticate to the other.   An Attacker breaks into a router that forwards messages between the Verifier and a Claimant. When forwarding messages, the Attacker substitutes his or her own public key for that of the Verifier. The Claimant is tricked into encrypting his or her password so that the Attacker can decrypt it.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   An Attacker sets up a fraudulent website impersonating the Verifier. When an unwary Claimant tries to log in using his or her one-time password device, the Attacker’s website simultaneously uses the Claimant’s one-time password to log in to the real Verifier.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Attacks are not limited to the authentication protocol itself. Other
attacks include:

-   Denial of Service attacks in which the Attacker overwhelms the
    Verifier by flooding it with a large amount of traffic over the
    authentication protocol;

-   Malicious code attacks that may compromise or otherwise exploit
    authentication tokens;

-   Attacks that fool Claimants into using an insecure protocol, when
    the Claimant thinks that he or she is using a secure protocol, or
    trick the Claimant into overriding security controls (for example,
    by accepting server certificates that cannot be validated).

The purpose of flooding attacks is to overwhelm the resources used to
support an authentication protocol to the point where legitimate
Claimants cannot reach the Verifier or to slow down the process to make
it more difficult for the Claimant to reach the Verifier. For example, a
Verifier that implements an authentication protocol that uses
encryption/decryption is sent a large number of protocol messages
causing the Verifier to be crippled due to the use of excessive system
resources to encrypt/decrypt. Nearly all authentication protocols are
susceptible to flooding attacks; possible ways to resist such attacks is
through the use of distributed Verifier architectures, use of load
balancing techniques to distribute protocol requests to multiple
mirrored Verifier systems, or other similar techniques.

Malicious code could be introduced into the Claimant’s computer system
for the purpose of compromising or otherwise exploiting the Claimant’s
token. The malicious code may be introduced by many means, including the
threats detailed below. There are many countermeasures (e.g., virus
checkers and firewalls) that can mitigate the risk of malicious code on
Claimant systems. General good practice to mitigate malicious code
threats is outside the scope of this document[^26]. Hardware tokens
prevent malicious software from extracting and copying the token secret.
However, malicious code may still misuse the token, particularly if
activation data is presented to the token via the computer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following are strategies that can be incorporated in authentication
processes to mitigate the attacks listed in the previous section:

-   *Online guessing resistance* – An authentication process is
    resistant to online guessing attacks if it is impractical for the
    Attacker, with no a priori knowledge of the token authenticator, to
    authenticate successfully by repeated authentication attempts with
    guessed authenticators. The entropy of the authenticator, the nature
    of the authentication protocol messages, and other management
    mechanisms at the Verifier contribute to this property. For example,
    password authentication systems can make targeted password guessing
    impractical by requiring use of high-entropy passwords and limiting
    the number of unsuccessful authentication attempts, or by
    controlling the rate at which attempts can be carried out. (See
    [](#_Appendix_A:_Estimating_Entropy and ) and Table 6 in
    Section 6.3.1.). Similarly, to resist untargeted password attacks, a
    Verifier may supplement these controls with network
    security controls.

-   *Phishing and pharming resistance (verifier impersonation)* – An
    authentication process is resistant to phishing and pharming (also
    known as Verifier impersonation,) if the impersonator does not learn
    the value of a token secret or a token authenticator that can be
    used to act as a Subscriber to the genuine Verifier. In the most
    general sense, this assurance can be provided by the same mechanisms
    that provide the strong man-in-the-middle resistance described later
    in this section; however, long term secrets can be protected against
    phishing and pharming simply by the use of a tamper resistant token,
    provided that the long term secret cannot be reconstructed from a
    Token Authenticator. To decrease the likelihood of phishing and
    pharming attacks, it is recommended that the Claimant authenticate
    the Verifier using cryptographic mechanisms prior to submitting the
    token authenticator to the supposed Verifier. Additionally,
    management mechanisms can be implemented at the Verifier to send a
    Claimant personalized content after successful authentication of the
    Claimant or the Claimant’s device. (Refer to Section 8.2.4 for
    further details on personalization.) This allows the Claimant to
    achieve a higher degree of assurance of the authenticity of the
    Verifier before proceeding with the remainder of the session with
    the Verifier or RP. It should be mentioned, however, that there is
    no foolproof way to prevent the Claimant from revealing any
    sensitive information to which he or she has access.

-   *Eavesdropping resistance* – An authentication process is resistant
    to eavesdropping attacks if an eavesdropper who records all the
    messages passing between a Claimant and a Verifier finds it
    impractical to learn the Claimant’s token secret or to otherwise
    obtain information that would allow the eavesdropper to impersonate
    the Subscriber in a future authentication session.
    Eavesdropping-resistant protocols make it impractical[^27] for an
    Attacker to carry out an off-line attack where he or she records an
    authentication protocol run and then analyzes it on his or her own
    system for an extended period to determine the token secret or
    possible token authenticators. For example, an Attacker who captures
    the messages of a password-based authentication protocol run may try
    to crack the password by systematically trying every password in a
    large dictionary, and comparing it with the protocol run data.
    Protected session protocols, such as TLS, provide
    eavesdropping resistance.

-   *Replay resistance* – An authentication process resists replay
    attacks if it is impractical to achieve a successful authentication
    by recording and replaying a previous authentication message.
    Protocols that use nonces or challenges to prove the “freshness” of
    the transaction are resistant to replay attacks since the Verifier
    will easily detect that the old protocol messages replayed do not
    contain the appropriate nonces or timeliness data related to the
    current authentication session.

-   *Hijacking resistance* – An authentication process and data transfer
    protocol combination are resistant to hijacking if the
    authentication is bound to the data transfer in a manner that
    prevents an adversary from participating actively in the data
    transfer session between the Subscriber and the Verifier or RP
    without being detected. This is a property of the relationship of
    the authentication protocol and the subsequent session protocol used
    to transfer data. This binding is usually accomplished by generating
    a per-session shared secret during the authentication process that
    is subsequently used by the Subscriber and the Verifier or RP to
    authenticate the transfer of all session data.

> browser.

-   *Man-in-the-middle resistance* – Authentication protocols are
    resistant to a man-in-the-middle attack when both parties (i.e.,
    Claimant and Verifier) are authenticated to the other in a manner
    that prevents the undetected participation of a third party. There
    are two levels of resistance:

1.  *Weak man-in-the-middle resistance* – A protocol is said to be
    weakly resistant to man-in-the-middle attacks if it provides a
    mechanism for the Claimant to determine whether he or she is
    interacting with the real Verifier, but still leaves the opportunity
    for the non-vigilant Claimant to reveal a token authenticator (to an
    unauthorized party) that can be used to masquerade as the Claimant
    to the real Verifier. For example, sending a password over server
    authenticated TLS is weakly resistant to man-in the middle attacks.
    The browser allows the Claimant to verify the identity of the
    Verifier; however, if the Claimant is not sufficiently vigilant, the
    password will be revealed to an unauthorized party who can abuse
    the information. Weak man-in-the-middle resistance can also be
    provided by a zero-knowledge password protocol, such as Encrypted
    Key Exchange (EKE), Simple Password Exponential Key Exchange
    (SPEKE), or Secure Remote Password Protocol (SRP), which enables the
    Claimant to authenticate to a Verifier without disclosing the
    token secret. However, it is possible for the Attacker to trick the
    Claimant into passing his or her password into a less secure
    protocol, thereby revealing the password to the Attacker.
    Furthermore, if it is unreasonably difficult for the Claimant to
    verify that the proper protocol is being used, then the overall
    authentication process does not even provide weak man-in-the-middle
    resistance (for example, if a zero-knowledge password protocol is
    implemented by an unsigned java applet displayed on a plaintext
    HTTP page).

2.  *Strong man-in-the-middle resistance*: A protocol is said to be
    strongly resistant to man-in-the-middle attack if it does not allow
    the Claimant to reveal, to an Attacker masquerading as the Verifier,
    information (token secrets, authenticators) that can be used by the
    latter to masquerade as the true Claimant to the real Verifier. An
    example of such a protocol is client authenticated TLS, where the
    browser and the web server authenticate one another using PKI. Even
    an unwary Claimant cannot easily reveal to an Attacker masquerading
    as the Verifier any information that can be used by the Attacker to
    authenticate to the real Verifier. Specialized protocols where the
    Claimant’s token device will only release an authenticator to a
    preset list of valid Verifiers may also be strongly resistant to
    man-in-the-middle attacks.

Note that systems can supplement the mitigation strategies listed above
by enforcing appropriate security policies. For example, device
identity, system health checks, and configuration management can be used
to mitigate the risk that the Claimant’s system has been compromised.

<span id="_Ref302670486" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc237074474" class="anchor"></span></span>Throttling Mechanisms  {#throttling-mechanisms .header3}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When using a token that produces low entropy token Authenticators, it is
necessary to implement controls at the Verifier to protect against
online guessing attacks. An explicit requirement for such tokens is
given in Table 6: the Verifier shall effectively limit online Attackers
to 100 failed attempts on a single account in any 30 day period.

The simplest way of implementing a throttling mechanism (which is not
the recommended approach) would be to keep a counter of failed attempts
that is reset at the beginning of each calendar month, and to lock the
account for the rest of the month, when the counter exceeds 50. Aside
from the fact that this system would not technically meet the
requirement on the first of March in non-leap years, this throttling
mechanism has a number of more severe problems. Most notably, it leaves
the Verifier open to a very easy denial of service attack (on the first
day of the month, an Attacker simply makes 50 failed attempts on each
Subscriber account he or she knows about, and the system is unusable for
the next 29 days.)

The above simple implementation is also sufficiently limiting that it
may suffer from usability problems, where the legitimate Subscriber is
penalized for behavior that could reasonably be identified as benign and
should not be counted as failed attempts by an Attacker. For example, if
the Verifier records a dozen failed authentication attempts followed by
a successful attempt from the same IP address over a few minutes to a
few hours, it would be reasonable to assume that those attempts did not
come from an Attacker.

Additional techniques can be used to prioritize authentication attempts
that are likely to come from the Subscriber over those that are more
likely to come from an Attacker.

-   Requiring the Claimant to complete a Completely Automated Public
    Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA) before
    attempting authentication.

-   Requiring the Claimant to wait for a short period of time (anything
    from 30 seconds to an hour, depending on how close the system is to
    its maximum allowance for failed attempts) before attempting
    Authentication following a failed attempt.

-   Only accepting authentication requests from a white list of IP
    addresses at which the Subscriber has been successfully
    authenticated before.

Since these measures often create user inconvenience, it is best to
allow a certain number of failed authentication attempts before
employing the above techniques. For example, a system which enforces the
30-day failed attempt limit, by dividing the calendar into 10-day
sub-periods and only allowing 25 failed attempts in each sub-period,
could allocate failed attempts as follows: in a given 10 day period, the
Verifier could allow 2 failed attempts each day regardless of any other
considerations, allow an additional 5 failed attempts over the whole
period with no additional protections, require CAPTCHAs for the next 5
failed attempts (beyond the 2-per-day quota), and only allow the final 5
attempts to come from a white-listed IP address after the Claimant has
completed a CAPTCHA.

Finally, if the Verifier accepts authentication attempts for a large
number of Subscribers, it is possible that an Attacker will attempt on
online attack on all Subscriber accounts simultaneously, hoping to gain
access to one of them, thus circumventing the throttling mechanisms
employed on the individual accounts. No specific guideline is given for
protecting against such attacks, but Verifiers with a large number of
Subscribers should take measures to detect such attacks and either
respond to them automatically or alert system administrators to the
threat.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is important to note that phishing and pharming are attacks that use
different techniques to achieve the same goal. Effectively, the Claimant
is tricked into believing that he or she is interacting with the
Verifier when in actuality, the Verifier is being impersonated by an
Attacker attempting to collect token information or other sensitive
information.

In a successful phishing attack, the Attacker sends an official looking
email to a Subscriber claiming to be a Verifier. The email usually
contains a link to a counterfeit Verifier and will ask the Subscriber to
click on the link and authenticate to the Verifier[^28]. The Subscriber
proceeds to authenticate to the counterfeit Verifier and the login
information and token authenticator is captured. At this point, the
Subscriber is unaware that he or she has been phished, and proceeds with
the actions requested by the original email. Once the Subscriber logs
off, he or she is unaware that his or her login information has been
captured and that potentially sensitive data has been captured.

In a successful pharming attack, the Attacker corrupts either the domain
name service (using a technique called DNS poisoning) or the local
routing tables (by modifying the host files on a Claimant’s computer to
point to a bogus DNS server). When the Subscriber attempts to connect to
a legitimate Verifier on the Internet, the corrupted DNS tables or
routing tables take the Subscriber to a counterfeit Verifier on the
Internet. The Subscriber unknowingly reveals token authenticators and
other sensitive information to the counterfeit Verifier.

The strongest mechanism for preventing phishing and pharming of
authentication secrets, such as token authenticators, is to make sure
that some authentication secrets are not directly accessible to the
Claimant (as described in Section 8.2.2). However, to help mitigate a
wider variety of phishing and pharming attacks, the following techniques
may be used:

-   *Out of band confirmation of transaction details* – Details (e.g.,
    account number, amount) of sensitive transactions authorized by the
    Subscriber may be sent by the RP to the Subscriber’s out of band
    token and displayed along with a confirmation code. The confirmation
    code may either be cryptographically derived from the Subscriber’s
    token secret and the transaction details, or it may be a random
    value that is sent to the Subscriber’s out of band token along with
    the transaction details. Alternatively, transaction details may be
    typed in by the Subscriber as manual inputs to a one-time
    password device. In order to complete the transaction, the
    Subscriber shall send the correct one-time password or confirmation
    code to the Verifier or RP.

-   *Adding a “Last Login” feature by the Verifier to inform the
    Subscriber of his or her last login* – If the Subscriber logged in
    at 8:00am and then logs in at 4:00pm but the Last Login feature
    states that the last login was at 2:00pm, the Subscriber may suspect
    that he or she has been phished and take appropriate action.

Personalization is the process of customizing a webpage or email for a
user to enhance the user experience. For the purpose of this document,
personalization schemes can assist the user to determine if he or she is
interacting with the correct entity. It is important to note that
personalization is at best a low assurance mechanism for mitigating
Phishing and Pharming threats, especially when delivered over a
communication protocol that is not strongly resistant to
man-in-the-middle attacks. However, personalization may provide
additional assurance when combined with other techniques.

There are three types of personalization in the context of this
guideline:

-   *Pre-authentication personalization* – The Verifier displays to the
    Claimant some personalized indicator (such as an image or
    user-chosen phrase picked at registration) prior to the latter
    submitting the token authenticator to the former. This indicator may
    be established by the Subscriber at the time of registration. When
    the Claimant views the personalized indicator, the Claimant has an
    increased sense of assurance that he or she is interacting with the
    correct Verifier. For example, a Verifier may require the Claimant
    to submit the username first; in response, the Verifier provides the
    personalized indicator for the claimed username. If the Claimant
    recognizes the personalized indicator as his or her own, the
    Claimant submits his or her token authenticator to the Verifier.
    Pre-authentication personalization does not eliminate Phishing
    attacks, but requires the Attacker to use a more complex technique
    to succeed in a Phishing attack.

-   *Post-authentication personalization* – The Verifier displays a
    personalized indicator to the Subscriber after successful
    authentication of the latter. The personalized indicator provides
    assurance to the Subscriber that he or she has in fact logged in to
    the correct site. This indicator may be established by the
    Subscriber at the time of registration. For example, after a
    Subscriber authenticates to the Verifier, the Verifier provides a
    personalized indicator (such as a picture, a phrase, or a greeting)
    that the Subscriber can readily recognize as his or her own. If the
    personalized indicator is not shown, or is not recognized by the
    Subscriber, the Subscriber suspects that he or she has been phished
    and takes appropriate action. Post-authentication personalization
    does not protect any secrets used by the Subscriber in the initial
    authentication process. Nonetheless, if some or all of these secrets
    are protected by hardware or software that runs a protocol with
    strong man-in-the-middle resistance, then the personalization will
    assist the Subscriber in recognizing that he or she is interacting
    with a bogus site and refraining from revealing any further
    sensitive information. If personalization appears before the
    Subscriber is prompted for a password, but after the Verifier
    strongly authenticates the Subscriber’s local system, then the
    Subscriber’s password may also be protected from phishing.

-   *Personalization of email sent to the Subscriber by a valid
    Verifier* – This type of personalization is employed to help the
    Subscriber differentiate between email from a valid Verifier, and
    email from a Phisher. For example, an email from a Verifier may
    contain a picture which the Subscriber selected in the
    registration process. This type of personalization forces the
    Phisher to use a fairly difficult attack and in effect forces the
    Phisher to either use a targeted attack against each Subscriber or
    hope that the Subscriber will not notice the incorrect or missing
    personalization identifier.

> It is important to note that using a Subscriber’s name (first or last)
> as the only method of personalization is a relatively weak method to
> thwart a phishing attack since it is fairly easy for an Attacker to
> gain this type of information and display it in an email or display it

> better candidate for use during personalization.

This section states the requirements levied on the authentication
process to achieve the required threat resistance at each assurance
level. At Levels 2 and above, the authentication process shall provide
sufficient information to the Verifier to uniquely identify the
appropriate registration information that was (i) provided by the
Subscriber at the time of registration, and (ii) verified by the RA in
the issuance of the token and credential. It is important to note that
the requirements listed below will not protect the authentication
process if malicious code is introduced on the Claimant’s machine or at
the Verifier.

#### <span id="_Toc151960529" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc151960836" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc151961142" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc151961450" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc151961757" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc151962063" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc151962370" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc146903995" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc146904139" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc146904284" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc146904430" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc146904575" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc146904718" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc146904865" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc7771272" class="anchor"></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>Level 1

Although there is no identity proofing requirement at this level, the
authentication mechanism provides some assurance that the same Claimant
who participated in previous transactions is accessing the protected
transaction or data. It allows a wide range of available authentication
technologies to be employed and permits the use of any of the token
methods of Levels 2, 3 or 4. Successful authentication requires that the
Claimant prove, through a secure authentication protocol, that he or she
possesses and controls the token.

Plaintext passwords or secrets shall not be transmitted across a network
at Level 1. However this level does not require cryptographic methods
that block offline analysis by eavesdroppers. For example, password
challenge-response protocols that combine a password with a challenge to
generate an authentication reply satisfy this requirement although an
eavesdropper who intercepts the challenge and reply may be able to
conduct a successful off-line dictionary or password exhaustion attack
and recover the password. Since an eavesdropper who intercepts such a
protocol exchange will often be able to find the password with a
straightforward dictionary attack, and this vulnerability is independent
of the strength of the operations, there is no requirement at this level
to use Approved cryptographic techniques. At Level 1, long-term shared
authentication secrets may be revealed to Verifiers.

A wide variety of technologies should be able to meet the requirements
of Level 1. For example, a Verifier might obtain a Subscriber password
from a CSP and authenticate the Claimant by use of a challenge-response
protocol. A password sent through a TLS protocol session is another
example. Other common protocols that meet Level 1 requirements include
APOP \[[RFC 1939](#RFC1939)\], S/KEY \[[RFC 1760](#SKEY)\], and
password-based versions of Kerberos \[[KERB](#KERB)\].

#### Level 2 

Level 2 allows a wide range of available authentication technologies to
be employed and permits the use of any of the token methods of Levels 2,
3 and 4. Successful authentication requires that the Claimant shall
prove, through a secure authentication protocol, that he or she controls
the token. Session hijacking (when required based on the FIPS 199
security category of the systems as described below), replay, and online
guessing attacks shall be resisted. Approved cryptography is required to
resist eavesdropping to capture authentication data. Protocols used at
Level 2 and above shall be at least weakly man-in-the-middle resistant,
as described in the threat mitigation strategies subsection.

Session data transmitted between the Claimant and the RP following a
successful Level 2 authentication shall be protected as described in the
NIST FISMA guidelines. Specifically, all session data exchanged between
information systems that are categorized as FIPS 199 “Moderate” or
“High” for confidentiality and integrity, shall be protected in
accordance with NIST SP 800-53 Control SC-8 (which requires transmission
confidentiality) and SC-9 (which requires transmission integrity).

A wide variety of technologies can meet the requirements of Level 2. For
example, a Verifier might authenticate a Claimant who provides a
password through a secure (encrypted) TLS protocol session (tunneling).

#### Level 3 

Level 3 provides multi-factor remote network authentication. At least
two authentication factors are required. Level 3 authentication is based
on proof of possession of the allowed types of tokens through a
cryptographic protocol. Level 3 also permits any of the token methods of
Level 4. Refer to Section 6 for requirements for single tokens and token
combinations that can achieve Level 3 authentication assurance.
Additionally, At Level 3, strong cryptographic mechanisms shall be used
to protect token secret(s) and authenticator(s). Long-term shared
authentication secrets, if used, shall never be revealed to any party
except the Claimant and CSP; however, session (temporary) shared secrets
may be provided to Verifiers by the CSP, possibly via the Claimant.
Approved cryptographic techniques shall be used for all operations
including the transfer of session data.

Level 3 assurance may be satisfied by client authenticated TLS
(implemented in all modern browsers), with Claimants who have public key
certificates. Other protocols with similar properties may also be used.

<span id="OLE_LINK5" class="anchor"></span>Level 3 authentication
assurance may also be met by tunneling the output of a MF OTP Token, or
the output of a SF OTP Token in combination with a Level 2 personal
password, through a TLS session.

#### Level 4 

Level 4 is intended to provide the highest practical remote network
authentication assurance. Refer to Section 6 for single tokens and token
combinations that are allowed to be used to achieve Level 4
authentication assurance.

Level 4 requires strong cryptographic authentication of all parties, and
all sensitive data transfers between the parties. Either public key or
symmetric key technology may be used. The token secret shall be
protected from compromise through the malicious code threat as described
in Section 8.2.1 above. Long-term shared authentication secrets, if
used, shall never be revealed to any party except the Claimant and CSP;
however session (temporary) shared secrets may be provided to Verifiers
or RPs by the CSP. Strong, Approved cryptographic techniques shall be
used for all operations including the transfer of session data. All
sensitive data transfers shall be cryptographically authenticated using
keys that are derived from the authentication process in such a way that
MitM attacks are strongly resisted.

Level 4 assurance may be satisfied by client authenticated TLS
(implemented in all modern browsers), with Claimants who have public key
MF Hardware Cryptographic Tokens. Other protocols with similar
properties can also be used.

It should be noted that, in multi-token schemes, the token used to
provide strong man-in-the-middle resistance need not be a hardware
token. For example, if a software cryptographic token is used to open a
client-authenticated TLS session, and the output of a multifactor OTP
device is sent by the claimant in that session, then the resultant
protocol will still provide Level 4 assurance.

Assertions are statements from a Verifier to an RP that contain
information about a Subscriber. Assertions are used when the RP and the
Verifier are not collocated (i.e., they are connected through a shared
network). The RP uses the information in the assertion to identify the
Claimant and make authorization decisions about his or her access to
resources controlled by the RP. An assertion may include identification
and authentication statements regarding the Subscriber, and may
additionally include attribute statements that further characterize the
Subscriber and support the authorization decision at the RP.

Assertion-based authentication of the Claimant serves several important
goals. It supports the process of Single-Sign-On for Claimants, allowing
them to authenticate once to a Verifier and subsequently obtain services
from multiple RPs without being aware of further authentication.
Assertion mechanisms also support the implementation of a federated
identity for a Subscriber, allowing the linkage of multiple
identities/accounts held by the Subscriber with different RPs through
the use of a common “federated” identifier. In this context, a
federation is a group of entities (RPs, Verifiers and CSPs) that are
bound together through common agreed-upon business practices, policies,
trust mechanisms, profiles and protocols. Finally, assertion mechanisms
can also facilitate authentication schemes that are based on the
attributes or characteristics of the Claimant in lieu of (or in addition
to) the identity of the Claimant. Attributes are often used in
determining access privileges for Attributes Based Access Control (ABAC)
or Role Based Access Control (RBAC).

It is important to note that assertion schemes are fairly complex
multiparty protocols, and therefore have fairly subtle security
requirements which shall be satisfied. When evaluating a particular
assertion scheme, it may be instructive to break it down into its
component interactions. Generally speaking, interactions between the
Claimant/Subscriber and the Verifier and between the Claimant/Subscriber
and RP are similar to the authentication mechanisms presented in Section
8, while interactions between the Verifier and RP are similar to the
*token and credential verification services* presented in Section 7.
Many of the requirements presented in this section will, therefore, be
similar to corresponding requirements in those two sections.

There are two basic models for assertion-based authentication. After
successful authentication with the Verifier, the Subscriber is issued an
assertion or an assertion reference, which the Subscriber uses to
authenticate to the RP.

-   *The Direct Model* – In the direct model<span id="OLE_LINK3"
    class="anchor"></span>, the Claimant uses his or her
    e-authentication token to authenticate to the Verifier. Following
    successful authentication of the Claimant, the Verifier creates an
    assertion, and sends it to the Subscriber to be forwarded to the RP.
    The assertion is used by the Claimant/Subscriber to authenticate to
    the RP. (This is usually handled automatically by the
    Subscriber’s browser.) Figure 4 illustrates this model.

<span id="_Ref296982999" class="anchor"></span>Figure - *Direct
Assertion Model*

-   *The Indirect Model* – In the indirect model, the Claimant uses his
    or her token to authenticate to the Verifier. Following successful
    authentication, the Verifier creates an assertion as well as an
    assertion reference (which identifies the Verifier and includes a
    pointer to the full assertion held by the Verifier). The assertion
    reference is sent to the Subscriber to be forwarded to the RP. In
    this model, the assertion reference is used by the
    Claimant/Subscriber to authenticate to the RP. The RP then uses the
    assertion reference to explicitly request the assertion from
    the Verifier. Figure 5 illustrates this model.

![](media/image7.png)

<span id="_Ref296983035" class="anchor"></span>Figure - *Indirect
Assertion Model*

As mentioned earlier, an assertion contains a set of claims or
statements about an authenticated Subscriber. Based on the statements
contained within it, an authentication assertion will fall into one of
two categories (and either category can be used in both direct and
indirect models):

-   *Holder-of-Key Assertions* – A holder-of-key assertion contains a
    reference to a symmetric key or a public key (corresponding to a
    private key) possessed by the Subscriber. The RP may require the
    Subscriber to prove possession of the secret that is referenced in
    the assertion. In proving possession of the Subscriber’s secret, the
    Subscriber also proves with a certain degree of assurance that he or
    she is the rightful owner of the assertion. It is therefore
    difficult for an Attacker to use a holder-of-key assertion issued to
    a Subscriber, since the former cannot prove possession of the secret
    referenced within the assertion.

-   *Bearer Assertions* – A bearer assertion does not provide a
    mechanism for the Claimant to prove that he or she is the rightful
    owner of the assertion. The RP has to assume that the assertion was
    issued to the Subscriber who presents the assertion or the
    corresponding assertion reference to the RP. If a bearer assertion
    (in the direct model) or assertion reference (in the indirect model)
    belonging to a Subscriber is captured, copied, or manufactured by an
    Attacker, the latter can impersonate the rightful Subscriber to
    obtain services from the RP. Bearer assertions can be made secure
    only if some part of the assertion or assertion reference, sent to
    the Subscriber by the Verifier, is unpredictable to an Attacker and
    can reliably be kept secret.

There are cases in which the RP should be anonymous to the Verifier for
the purpose of privacy. The direct model is more suitable for the
“anonymous RP” scenario since there is no requirement for the RP to
authenticate to the Verifier as in the indirect model. However, it is
possible to devise authentication schemes (e.g., using key hierarchies
within a group or federation) that allow the use of the indirect model
to support the “anonymous RP” scenario.

There are other cases where privacy concerns require that the Claimant’s
identity/account at the Verifier and RP not be linked through use of a
common identifier/account name. In such scenarios, pseudonymous
identifiers are used within the assertions generated by the Verifier for
the RP.

It should be noted that the two models described above are abstractions.
There may be other interactions between the three players preceding or
interspersed with the interactions described in the model. For example,
the Claimant may initiate a connection with an RP of his or her choice,
at which point, the latter would redirect the Claimant to an appropriate
Verifier to be authenticated using the direct model, resulting in an
assertion being sent to the RP. Alternately, the Claimant may first
authenticate to a Verifier of his or her choice and then select one or
more RPs to obtain further services. The direct model is used to
generate assertions for each of these RPs. Parallel scenarios may be
constructed for the indirect model as well.

There is one other basic assertion model.

-   *The Proxy Model* – In the proxy model, the Claimant uses his or her
    e-authentication token to authenticate to the Verifier. Following
    successful authentication of the Claimant, the Verifier creates an
    assertion and includes it when interacting directly with the RP,
    acting as an intermediary between the Claimant and the RP. Figure 6
    illustrates this model.

<span id="_Ref296983063" class="anchor"></span>Figure – *Proxy Model*

-   Web caching mechanisms that are required to satisfy the RP’s access

    Claimant is required

-   Network monitoring and/or filtering mechanisms that terminate TLS in
    order to inspect and manipulate the traffic

Three types of assertion technologies will be discussed within this
section: Web browser cookies, SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)
assertions, and Kerberos tickets. Other assertion technologies may be
used in an e-authentication environment as long as they meet the
requirements set forth in Section 9.3 below for the targeted assurance
level.

<span id="_Ref302316554" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc237074481" class="anchor"></span></span>Cookies {#cookies .header3}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One type of assertion widely in use is Web cookie technology. Cookies
are text files used by a browser to store information provided by a
particular web site. The contents of the cookie are sent back to the web
site each time the browser requests a page from the same web site. The
web site uses the contents of the cookie to identify the user and
prepare customized Web pages for that user, or to authorize the user for
certain transactions.

Cookies have two mandatory parameters:

-   *Name* – This parameter states the name of the cookie.

-   *Value* – This parameter holds information that a cookie is storing.
    For example, the value parameter could hold a user ID or session ID.

Cookies also have four optional parameters:

-   *Expiration date* – This parameter determines how long the cookie
    stays valid.

-   *Path* – This parameter sets the path over which the cookie
    is valid.

-   *Domain* – This parameter determines the domain in which the cookie
    is valid.

-   *Secure* – This parameter indicates the cookie requires that a
    secure connection exist for the cookie to be used.

There are two types of cookies:

-   *Session cookies* – A cookie that is erased when the user closes the
    web browser. The session cookie is stored in temporary memory and is
    not retained after the browser is closed.

-   *Persistent cookies* – A cookie that is stored on a user’s hard
    drive until it expires (persistent cookies are set with
    expiration dates) or until the user deletes the cookie.

Cookies are effective as assertions for Internet single-sign-on where
the RP and Verifier are part of the same Internet domain, and when the
cookie contains authentication status for that domain. They are not
usable in scenarios where the RP and the Verifier are part of disparate
domains.

Cookies are also often used by the Claimant to re-authenticate to a
server. This may be considered to be a use of assertion technology. In
this case, the server acts as a Verifier when it sets the cookie in the
Subscriber’s browser, and as an RP when it requests the cookie from a
Claimant who wishes to re-authenticate to it. Often, the cookie contains
a random number, and the assertion data that it represents does not
leave the server. Note that, if the cookie is used as an assertion
reference in this way, no assertion needs to be sent on an open network,
and therefore, confidentiality and integrity requirements for assertion
data at Level 2 and below may be satisfied by access controls rather
than by cryptographic methods. (The cookie itself, however, does need to
be protected.) This is in line with the credential storage requirement
presented in Section 7.

Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) Assertions {#security-assertion-markup-language-saml-assertions .header3}
----------------------------------------------------

SAML is an XML-based framework for creating and exchanging
authentication and attribute information between trusted entities over
the Internet. As of this writing, the latest specification for
\[[SAML](#SAML)\] is SAML v2.0, issued 15 March 2005.

The building blocks of SAML include the Assertions XML schema which
define the structure of the assertion; the SAML Protocols which are used
to request assertions and artifacts (that is, the assertion reference
mentioned in Section 9.1); and the Bindings that define the underlying
communication protocols (such as HTTP or SOAP) and that can be used to
transport the SAML assertions. The three components above define a SAML
profile that corresponds to a particular use case such as “Web Browser
SSO”.

SAML Assertions are encoded in an XML schema and can carry up to three
types of statements:

-   *Authentication statements* – Include information about the
    assertion issuer, the authenticated subject, validity period, and
    other authentication information. For example, an Authentication
    Assertion would state the subject “John” was authenticated using a
    password at 10:32pm on 06-06-2004.

-   *Attribute statements* – Contain specific additional characteristics
    related to the Subscriber. For example, subject “John” is associated
    with attribute “Role” with value “Manager”.

-   *Authorization statements* – Identify the resources the Subscriber
    has permission to access. These resources may include specific
    devices, files, and information on specific web servers. For
    example, subject “John” for action “Read” on “Webserver1002” given
    evidence “Role”.

Authorization statements are beyond the scope of this document and will
not be discussed.

Kerberos Tickets  {#kerberos-tickets .header3}
-----------------

The Kerberos Network Authentication Service \[[RFC 4120](#RFC4120)\] was
designed to provide strong authentication for client/server applications
using symmetric-key cryptography. Extensions to Kerberos can support the
use of public key cryptography for selected steps of the protocol.
Kerberos also supports confidentiality and integrity protection of
session data between the Subscriber and the RP.

Kerberos supports authentication of a Claimant over an untrusted, shared
network using two or more Verifiers. The Claimant implicitly
authenticates to the Verifier by demonstrating the ability to decrypt a
random session key encrypted for the Subscriber by the Verifier. (Some
Kerberos variants also require the Subscriber to explicitly authenticate
to the Verifier, but this is not universal.) In addition to the
encrypted session key, the Verifier also generates another encrypted
object called a Kerberos ticket. The ticket contains the same session
key, the identity of the Subscriber to whom the session key was issued,
and an expiration time after which the session key is no longer valid.
The ticket is confidentiality and integrity protected by a
pre-established that is key shared between the Verifier and the RP.

To authenticate using the session key, the Claimant sends the ticket to
the RP along with encrypted data that proves that the Claimant possesses
the session key embedded within the Kerberos ticket. Session keys are
either used to generate new tickets, or to encrypt and authenticate
communications between the Subscriber and the RP.

To begin the process, the Claimant sends an authentication request to
the Authentication Server (AS). The AS encrypts a session key for the
Subscriber using the Subscriber’s long term credential. The long term
credential may either be a secret key shared between the AS and the
Subscriber, or in the PKINIT variant of Kerberos, a public key
certificate. It should be noted that most variants of Kerberos based on
a shared secret key between the Subscriber and Verifier derive this key
from a user generated password. As such, they are vulnerable to offline
dictionary attack by a passive eavesdropper.

In addition to delivering the session key to the subscriber, the AS also
issues a ticket using a key it shares with the Ticket Granting Server
(TGS). This ticket is referred to as a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT),
since the verifier uses the session key in the TGT to issue tickets
rather than to explicitly authenticate the Claimant. The TGS uses the
session key in the TGT to encrypt a new session key for the Subscriber
and uses a key it shares with the RP to generate a ticket corresponding
to the new session key. The subscriber decrypts the session key and uses
the ticket and the new session key together to authenticate to the RP.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this section, it is assumed that the two endpoints of the assertion
transmission (namely, the Verifier and the RP) are uncompromised.
However, the Claimant is not assumed to be entirely trustworthy as the
Claimant may have an interest in modifying or replacing an assertion to
obtain a greater level of access to a resource/service provided by the
RP. Other Attackers are assumed to lurk within the shared transmission
medium (e.g., Internet) and may be interested in obtaining or modifying
assertions and assertion references to impersonate a Subscriber or
access unauthorized data or services. Furthermore, it is possible that
two or more entities may be colluding to attack another party. An
Attacker may attempt to subvert assertion protocols by directly
compromising the integrity or confidentiality of the assertion data. For
the purpose of this type of threat, authorized parties who attempt to
exceed their privileges may be considered Attackers.

-   *Assertion manufacture/modification* – An Attacker may generate a
    bogus assertion or modify the assertion content (such as the
    authentication or attribute statements) of an existing assertion,
    causing the RP to grant inappropriate access to the Subscriber. For
    example, an Attacker may modify the assertion to extend the validity
    period; a Subscriber may modify the assertion to have access to
    information that they should not be able to view.

-   *Assertion disclosure* – Assertions may contain authentication and
    attribute statements that include sensitive Subscriber information.
    Disclosure of the assertion contents can make the Subscriber
    vulnerable to other types of attacks.

-   *Assertion repudiation by the Verifier* – An assertion may be
    repudiated by a Verifier if the proper mechanisms are not in place.
    For example, if a Verifier does not digitally sign an assertion, the
    Verifier can claim that it was not generated through the services of
    the Verifier.

-   *Assertion repudiation by the Subscriber* – Since it is possible for
    a compromised or malicious subscriber to issue assertions to the
    wrong party, a subscriber can repudiate any transaction with the RP
    that was authenticated using only a bearer assertion.

-   *Assertion redirect*: An Attacker uses the assertion generated for
    one RP to obtain access to a second RP.

-   *Assertion reuse* – An Attacker attempts to use an assertion that
    has already been used once with the intended RP.

In addition to reliable and confidential transmission of assertion data
from the Verifier to the RP, assertion protocols have a further goal: in
order for the Subscriber to be recognized by the RP, he or she shall be
issued some secret information, the knowledge of which distinguishes the
Subscriber from Attackers who wish to impersonate the Subscriber. In the
case of holder-of-key assertions, this secret is generally the
Subscriber’s long term token secret, which would already have been
established with the CSP prior to the initiation of the assertion
protocol.[^31]

In other cases, however, the Verifier will generate a temporary secret
and transmit it to the authenticated Subscriber for this purpose. Since,
when this secret is used to authenticate to the RP, it generally
replaces the token authenticator in the type of protocols described in
Section 8, this temporary secret will be referred to here as a secondary
authenticator. Secondary authenticators include assertions in the direct
model, session keys in Kerberos, assertion references in the indirect
model, and cookies used for authentication. The threats to the secondary
authenticator are as follows:

-   *Secondary authenticator manufacture* – An Attacker may attempt to
    generate a valid secondary authenticator and use it to impersonate
    a Subscriber.

-   *Secondary authenticator capture* – The Attacker may use a session
    hijacking attack to capture the secondary authenticator when the
    Verifier transmits it to the Subscriber after the primary
    authentication step, or the Attacker may use a man-in-the-middle
    attack to obtain the secondary authenticator as it is being used by
    the Subscriber to authenticate to the RP. If, as in the indirect
    model, the RP needs to send the secondary authenticator back to the
    Verifier in order to check its validity or obtain the corresponding
    assertion data, an Attacker may similarly subvert the communication
    protocol between the Verifier and the RP to capture a
    secondary authenticator. In any of the above scenarios, the
    secondary authenticator can be used to impersonate the Subscriber.

Finally, in order for the Subscriber’s authentication to the RP to be
useful, the binding between the secret used to authenticate to the RP
and the assertion data referring to the Subscriber shall be strong.

-   *Assertion substitution* – A subscriber may attempt to impersonate a
    more privileged subscriber by subverting the communication channel
    between the Verifier and RP, for example by reordering the messages,
    to convince the RP that his or her secondary authenticator
    corresponds to assertion data sent on behalf of the more
    privileged subscriber. This is primarily a threat to the indirect
    model, since in the direct model, assertion data is directly encoded
    in the secondary authenticator.

    1.  Threat Mitigation Strategies {#threat-mitigation-strategies-4 .header3}
        ----------------------------

Mitigation techniques are described below for each of the threats
described in the last subsection.

Logically speaking, an assertion is issued by a Verifier and consumed by
an RP – these are the two end points of the session that needs to be
secured to protect the assertion. In the direct model, the session in
which the assertion is passed traverses the Subscriber. Furthermore, in
the current web environment, the assertion may pass through two separate
secure sessions (one between the Verifier and the Subscriber, and the
other between the Subscriber and the RP), with a break in session
security on the Subscriber’s browser. This is reflected in the
mitigation strategies described below. In the indirect model, the
assertion flows directly from the Verifier to the RP; this protocol
session needs to be protected. All of the threat mitigation strategies
in Section 8 apply to the protocols used to request, retrieve and submit
assertions and assertion references.

-   *Assertion manufacture/modification*: To mitigate this threat, one
    of the following mechanisms may be used:

1.  The assertion may be digitally signed by the Verifier. The RP should
    check the digital signature to verify that it was issued by a
    legitimate Verifier.

2.  The assertion may be sent over a protected session such as TLS. In
    order to protect the integrity of assertions from malicious attack,
    the Verifier shall be authenticated.

-   *Assertion disclosure* – To mitigate this threat, one of the
    following mechanisms may be implemented:

1.  The assertion may be sent over a protected session to an
    authenticated RP. Note that, in order to protect assertions against
    both disclosure and manufacture/modification using a protected
    session, both the RP and the Verifier need to be authenticated.

2.  If assertions are signed by the Verifier, they may be encrypted for
    a specific RP with no additional integrity protection. It should be
    noted that any protocol that requires a series of messages between
    two parties to be signed by their source and encrypted for their
    recipient provides all the same guarantees as a mutually
    authenticated protected session, and may therefore be
    considered equivalent. The general requirement for protecting
    against both assertion disclosure and assertion
    manufacture/modification may therefore be described as a mutually
    authenticated protected session or equivalent between Verifier
    and RP.

-   *Assertion repudiation by the Verifier* – To mitigate this threat,
    the assertion may be digitally signed by the Verifier using a key
    that supports non-repudiation. The RP should check the digital
    signature to verify that it was issued by a legitimate Verifier.

-   *Assertion repudiation by the Subscriber* – To mitigate this threat,
    the Verifier may issue holder of key, rather than bearer assertions.
    The Subscriber can then prove possession of the asserted key to
    the RP. If the asserted key matches the subscriber’s long term
    credential (as provided by the CSP) it will be clear to all parties
    involved that it was the Subscriber who authenticated to the RP
    rather than a compromised Verifier impersonating the Subscriber.

-   *Assertion redirect* – To mitigate this threat, the assertion may
    include the identity of the RP for whom it was generated. The RP
    verifies that incoming assertions include its identity as the
    recipient of the assertion.

-   *Assertion reuse* – To mitigate this threat, the following
    mechanisms may be used:

1.  The assertion includes a timestamp and has a short lifetime
    of validity. The RP checks the timestamp and lifetime values to
    ensure that the assertion is currently valid. The lifetime value may
    either be in the assertion or set by the RP.

2.  The RP keeps track of assertions that were consumed within
    a (configurable) time window to ensure that an assertion cannot be
    used more than once within that time window.

-   *Secondary authenticator manufacture* – To mitigate this threat, one
    of the following mechanisms may be implemented:

1.  The secondary authenticator may contain sufficient entropy that an
    Attacker without direct access to the Verifier’s random number
    generator cannot guess the value of a valid secondary authenticator.

2.  The secondary authenticator may contain timely assertion data that
    is signed by the Verifier or integrity protected using a key shared
    between the Verifier and the RP.

3.  The Subscriber may authenticate to the RP directly using his or her
    long term token and avoid the need for a secondary
    authenticator altogether.

-   *Secondary authenticator capture* – To mitigate this threat,
    adequate protections shall be in place throughout the lifetime of
    any secondary authenticators used in the assertion protocol.

1.  In order to protect the secondary authenticator while it is in
    transit between the Verifier and the Subscriber, the secondary
    authenticator shall be sent via a protected session established
    during the primary authentication of the Subscriber using his or
    her token. This requirement is the same as the requirement in
    Section 8, regarding the Authentication Process, to protect
    sensitive data (in this case the secondary authenticator) from
    session hijacking attacks.

2.  In order to protect the secondary authenticator from capture as it
    is submitted to the RP, the secondary authenticator shall be used in
    an authentication protocol which protects against eavesdropping and
    man-in-the-middle attacks as described in Section 8.

3.  In order to protect the secondary authenticator after it has been
    used, it shall never be transmitted on an unprotected session or to
    an unauthenticated party while it is still valid. The secondary
    authenticator may be sent in the clear only if the sending party has
    strong assurances that the secondary authenticator will not
    subsequently be accepted by any other RP. This is possible if the
    secondary authenticator is specific to a single RP, and if that RP
    will not accept secondary authenticators with the same value until
    the maximum lifespan of the corresponding assertion has passed.

-   *Assertion substitution* – To mitigate this threat, one of the
    following mechanisms may be implemented:

1.  Responses to assertion requests, signed or integrity protected by
    the Verifier, may contain the value of the assertion reference used
    in the request or some other nonce that was cryptographically bound
    to the request by the RP.

2.  Responses to assertion requests may be bound to the corresponding
    requests by message order, as in HTTP, provided that assertions and
    requests are protected by a protocol such as TLS that can detect and
    disallow malicious reordering of packets.

Requirements per Assurance Level {#requirements-per-assurance-level-3 .header3}
--------------------------------

The following sections summarize the requirements for assertions at each
assurance level.

All assertions recognized within this guideline shall indicate the
assurance level of the initial authentication of the Claimant to the
Verifier. The assurance level indication within the assertion may be
implicit (e.g., through the identity of the Verifier implicitly
indicating the resulting assurance level) or explicit (e.g., through an
explicit field within the assertion).

#### Level 1

At Level 1, it must be impractical for an Attacker to manufacture an
assertion or assertion reference that can be used to impersonate the
Subscriber. If the direct model is used, the assertion which is used
shall be signed by the Verifier or integrity protected using a secret
key shared by the Verifier and RP, and if the indirect model is used,
the assertion reference which is used shall have a minimum of 64 bits of
entropy. Bearer assertions shall be specific to a single
transaction.[^33] Also, if assertion references are used, they shall be
freshly generated whenever a new assertion is created by the Verifier.
In other words, bearer assertions and assertion references are generated
for one-time use.

Furthermore, in order to protect assertions against modification in the
indirect model, all assertions sent from the Verifier to the RP shall
either be signed by the Verifier, or transmitted from an authenticated
Verifier via a protected session. In either case, a strong mechanism
must be in place which allows the RP to establish a binding between the
assertion reference and its corresponding assertion, based on integrity
protected (or signed) communications with the authenticated Verifier.

To lessen the impact of captured assertions and assertion references,
assertions that are consumed by an RP which is not part of the same
Internet domain as the Verifier shall expire if they are not used within
5 minutes of their creation. Assertions intended for use within a single
Internet domain, including assertions contained in or referenced by
cookies, however, may last as long as 12 hours without being used.

#### Level 2

If the underlying credential specifies that the subscriber name is a
pseudonym, this information must be conveyed in the assertion. Level 2
assertions shall be protected against manufacture/modification, capture,
redirect and reuse. Assertion references shall be protected against
manufacture, capture and reuse. Each assertion shall be targeted for a
single RP and the RP shall validate that it is the intended recipient of
the incoming assertion.

All stipulations from Level 1 apply. Additionally, assertions, assertion
references and any session cookies used by the Verifier or RP for
authentication purposes, shall be transmitted to the Subscriber through
a protected session which is linked to the primary authentication
process in such a way that session hijacking attacks are resisted (see
Section 8.2.2 for methods which may be used to protect against session
hijacking attacks). Assertions, assertion references and session cookies
shall not be subsequently transmitted over an unprotected session or to
an unauthenticated party while they remain valid. (To this end, any
session cookies used for authentication purposes shall be flagged as
secure, and redirects used to forward secondary authenticators from the
Subscriber to the RP shall specify a secure protocol such as HTTPS.)

To protect assertions against manufacture, modification, and disclosure,
assertions which are sent from the Verifier to the RP, whether directly
or through the Subscriber’s device, shall either be sent via a mutually
authenticated protected session between the Verifier and RP, or
equivalently shall be signed by the Verifier and encrypted for the RP.

All assertion protocols used at Level 2 and above require the use of
Approved cryptographic techniques. As such, the use of Kerberos keys
derived from user generated passwords is not permitted at Level 2 or
above.

#### Level 3

At Level 3, in addition to Level 2 requirements, assertions shall be
protected against repudiation by the Verifier; all assertions used at
Level 3 shall be signed. Level 3 assertions shall specify verified names
and not pseudonyms.

Kerberos uses symmetric key mechanisms to protect key management and
session data, and it does not protect against assertion repudiation.
However, based on the high degree of vetting conducted on the Kerberos
protocol and its wide deployment, Kerberos tickets are acceptable for
use as assertions at Level 3 as long as:

-   All Verifiers (Kerberos Authentication Servers and Ticket
    Granting Servers) are under the control of a single management
    authority that ensures the correct operation of the Kerberos
    protocol;

-   The Subscriber authenticates to the Verifier using a Level 3 token;

-   All Level 3 requirements unrelated to non-repudiation are satisfied.

Also, at Level 3, single-domain assertions (e.g., Web browser cookies)
shall expire if they are not used within 30 minutes. Cross-domain
assertions shall expire if not used within 5 minutes.

However, in order to deliver the effect of single sign on, the Verifier
may re-authenticate the Subscriber prior to delivering assertions to new
RPs, using a combination of long term and short term single domain
assertions provided that the following assurances are met:

-   The Subscriber has successfully authenticated to the Verifier within
    the last 12 hours.

-   The Subscriber can demonstrate that he or she was the party that
    authenticated to the Verifier. This could be demonstrated, for
    example, by the presence of a cookie set by the Verifier in the
    Subscriber’s browser.

-   The Verifier can reliably determine whether the Subscriber has been
    in active communication with an RP since the last assertion was
    delivered by the Verifier. This means that the Verifier needs
    evidence that the Subscriber is actively using the services of the
    RP and has not been idle for more than 30 minutes. An authenticated
    assertion by the RP to this effect is considered sufficient evidence
    for this purpose.

    1.  #### <span id="_Toc164136908" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc164226299" class="anchor"></span></span>Level 4

At Level 4, bearer assertions (including cookies) shall not be used to
establish the identity of the Claimant to the RP. Assertions made by the
Verifier may however be used to bind keys or other attributes to an
identity. Holder-of-key assertions may be used, provided that all three
requirements below are met:

-   The Claimant authenticates to the Verifier using a Level 4 token (as
    described in Section 6) in a Level 4 authentication protocol (as
    described in Section 8).

-   The Verifier generates a holder-of-key assertion that references a
    key that is part of the Level 4 token (used to authenticate to
    the Verifier) or linked to it through a chain of trust, and;

-   The RP verifies that the Subscriber possesses the key that is
    referenced in the holder-of-key assertion using a Level 4 protocol
    (where the RP plays the role attributed to the Verifier by
    Section 8).

The RP should maintain records of the assertions it receives, so that if
a suspicious transaction occurs at the RP, the key asserted by the
Verifier may be compared to the value registered with the CSP. This
record keeping allows the RP to detect any attempt by the Verifier to
impersonate the Subscriber using fraudulent assertions and may also be
useful for preventing the Subscriber from repudiating various aspects of
the authentication process.

Kerberos uses symmetric key mechanisms to protect key management and
session data, and it does not protect against assertion repudiation by
the Subscriber or the Verifier. However, based on the high degree of
vetting conducted on the Kerberos protocol and its wide deployment,
Kerberos tickets are acceptable for use as assertions at Level 4 as long
as:

-   All Verifiers (Kerberos Authentication Servers and Ticket
    Granting Servers) are under the control of a single management
    authority that ensures the correct operation of the Kerberos
    protocol;

-   The Subscriber authenticates to the Verifier using a Level 4 token;

-   All Level 4 requirements unrelated to non-repudiation are satisfied.

All Level 1-3 requirements for the protection of assertion data remain
in force at Level 4.

Passwords represent a very popular implementation of memorized secret
tokens. In this case impersonation of an identity requires only that the
impersonator obtain the password. Moreover, the ability of humans to
remember long, arbitrary passwords is limited, so passwords are often
vulnerable to a variety of attacks including guessing, use of
dictionaries of common passwords, and brute force attacks of all
possible password combinations. There are a wide variety of password
authentication protocols that differ significantly in their
vulnerabilities, and many password mechanisms are vulnerable to passive
and active network attacks. While some cryptographic password protocols
resist nearly all direct network attacks, these techniques are not at
present widely used and all password authentication mechanisms are
vulnerable to keyboard loggers and observation of the password when it
is entered. Experience also shows that users are vulnerable to “social
engineering” attacks where they are persuaded to reveal their passwords
to unknown parties, who are basically “confidence men.”

Claude Shannon coined the use of the term “entropy[^34]” in information
theory. The concept has many applications to information theory and
communications and Shannon also applied it to express the amount of
actual information in English text. Shannon says, “The entropy is a
statistical parameter which measures in a certain sense, how much
information is produced on the average for each letter of a text in the
language. If the language is translated into binary digits (0 or 1) in
the most efficient way, the entropy H is the average number of binary
digits required per letter of the original language.”[^35]

Entropy in this sense is at most only loosely related to the use of the
term in thermodynamics. A mathematical definition of entropy in terms of
the probability distribution function is:

![](media/image9.wmf)where *P*(*X*=*x*) is the probability that the
variable *X* has the value *x*.

Shannon was interested in strings of ordinary English text and how many
bits it would take to code them in the most efficient way possible.
Since Shannon coined the term, “entropy” has been used in cryptography
as a measure of the difficulty in guessing or determining a password or
a key. Clearly the strongest key or password of a particular size is a
truly random selection, and clearly, on average such a selection cannot
be compressed. However it is far from clear that compression is the best
measure for the strength of keys and passwords, and cryptographers have
derived a number of alternative forms or definitions of entropy,
including “guessing entropy” and “min-entropy.” As applied to a
distribution of passwords the guessing entropy is, roughly speaking, an
estimate of the average amount of work required to guess the password of
a selected user, and the min-entropy is a measure of the difficulty of
guessing the easiest single password to guess in the population.

If we had a good knowledge of the frequency distribution of passwords
chosen under a particular set of rules, then it would be straightforward
to determine either the guessing entropy or the min-entropy of any
password. An Attacker who knew the password distribution would find the
password of a chosen user by first trying the most probable password for
that chosen username, then the second most probable password for that
username and so on in decreasing order of probability until the Attacker
found the password that worked with the chosen username. The average for
all passwords would be the guessing entropy. The Attacker who is content
to find the password of any user would follow a somewhat different
strategy, he would try the most probable password with every username,
then the second most probable password with every username, until he
found the first “hit.” This corresponds to the min-entropy.

Unfortunately, we do not have much data on the passwords users choose
under particular rules, and much of what we do know is found empirically
by “cracking” passwords, that is by system administrators applying
massive dictionary attacks to the files of hashed passwords (in most
systems no plaintext copy of the password is kept) on their systems.
NIST would like to obtain more data on the passwords users actually
choose, but, where they have the data, system administrators are
understandably reluctant to reveal password data to others. Empirical
and anecdotal data suggest that many users choose very easily guessed
passwords, where the system will allow them to do so.

As we use the term here, “entropy” denotes the uncertainty in the value
of a password. Entropy of passwords is conventionally expressed in bits.
If a password of *k* bits is chosen at random there are 2*^k^* possible
values and the password is said to have *k* bits of entropy. If a
password of length *l* characters is chosen at random from an alphabet
of *b* characters (for example the 94 printable ISO characters on a
typical keyboard) then the entropy of the password is *b^l^* (for
example if a password composed of 8 characters from the alphabet of 94
printable ISO characters the entropy is 94^8^ ≈ 6.09 x 10^15^ – this is
about 2^52^, so such a password is said to have about 52 bits of
entropy). For randomly chosen passwords, guessing entropy, min-entropy,
and Shannon entropy are all the same value. The general formula for
entropy, *H* is given by:

> *H* = log~2~ (*b^l^*)

Table A.1 gives the entropy versus length for a randomly generated
password chosen from the standard 94 keyboard characters (not including
the space). Calculation of randomly selected passwords from other
alphabets is straightforward.

It is much more difficult to estimate the entropy in passwords that
users choose for themselves, because they are not chosen at random and
they will not have a uniform random distribution. Passwords chosen by
users probably roughly reflect the patterns and character frequency
distributions of ordinary English text, and are chosen by users so that
they can remember them. Experience teaches us that many users, left to
choose their own passwords will choose passwords that are easily guessed
and even fairly short dictionaries of a few thousand commonly chosen
passwords, when they are compared to actual user chosen passwords,
succeed in “cracking” a large share of those passwords.

**A.2.1 Guessing Entropy Estimate **

Guessing entropy is arguably the most critical measure of the strength
of a password system, since it largely determines the resistance to
targeted, online password guessing attacks.

In these guidelines, we have chosen to use Shannon’s estimate of the
entropy in ordinary English text as the starting point to estimate the
entropy of user-selected passwords. It is a big assumption that
passwords are quite similar to other English text, and it would be
better if we had a large body of actual user selected passwords,
selected under different composition rules, to work from, but we have no
such resource, and it is at least plausible to use Shannon’s work for a
“ballpark” estimate. Readers are cautioned against interpreting the
following rules as anything more than a very rough rule of thumb method
to be used for the purposes of e-authentication.

Shannon conducted experiments where he gave people strings of English
text and asked them to guess the next character in the string. From this
he estimated the entropy of each successive character. He used a
27-character alphabet, the ordinary English lower case letters plus the
space.

In the following discussion we assume that passwords are user selected
from the normal keyboard alphabet of 94 printable characters, and are at
least 6-characters long. Since Shannon used a 27 character alphabet it
may seem that the entropy of user selected passwords would be much
larger, however the assumption here is that users will choose passwords
that are almost entirely lower case letters, unless forced to do
otherwise, and that rules that force them to include capital letters or
non-alphabetic characters will generally be satisfied in the simplest
and most predictable manner, often by putting a capital letter at the
start (as we do in ordinary English) and punctuation or special
characters at the end, or by some simple substitution, such as \$ for
the letter “s.” Moreover rules that force passwords to appear to be
highly random will be counterproductive because they will make the
passwords hard to remember. Users will then write the passwords down and
keep them in a convenient (that is insecure) place, such as pasted on
their monitor. Therefore it is reasonable to start from estimates of the
entropy of simple English text, assuming only a 27-symbol alphabet.

Shannon observed that, although there is a non-uniform probability
distribution of letters, it is comparatively hard to predict the first
letter of an English text string, but, given the first letter, it is
much easier to guess the second and given the first two the third is
easier still, and so on. He estimated the entropy of the first symbol at
4.6 to 4.7 bits, declining to on the order of about 1.5 bits after 8
characters. Very long English strings (for example the collected works
of Shakespeare) have been estimated to have as little as .4 bits of
entropy per character.[^36] Similarly, in a string of words, it is
harder to predict the first letter of a word than the following letters,
and the first letter carries about 6 times more information than the
fifth or later letters[^37].

An Attacker attempting to find a password will try the most likely
chosen passwords first. Very extensive dictionaries of passwords have
been created for this purpose. Because users often choose common words
or very simple passwords systems commonly impose rules on password
selection in an attempt to prevent the choice of “bad” passwords and
improve the resistance of user chosen passwords to such dictionary or
rule driven password guessing attacks. For the purposes of these
guidelines, we break those rules into two categories:

1.  Dictionary tests that test prospective passwords against an
    “extensive dictionary test” of common words and commonly used
    passwords, then disallow passwords found in the dictionary. We do
    not precisely define a dictionary test, since it must be tailored to
    the password length and rules, but it should prevent selection of
    passwords that are simple transformations of any one word found in
    an unabridged English dictionary, and should include at least
    50,000 words. There is no intention to prevent selection of long
    passwords (16 characters or more based on phrases) and no need to
    impose a dictionary test on such long passwords of 16 characters
    or more.

2.  Composition rules that typically require users to select passwords
    that include lower case letters, upper case letters, and
    non-alphabetic symbols
    (e.g.;: “\~!@\#\$%\^&\*()\_-+={}\[\]|\\:;’&lt;,&gt;.?/1234567890”).

Either dictionary tests or composition rules eliminate some passwords
and reduce the space that an adversary must test to find a password in a
guessing or exhaustion attack. However they can eliminate many obvious
choices and therefore we believe that they generally improve the
“practical entropy” of passwords, although they reduce the work required
for a truly exhaustive attack. The dictionary check requires a
dictionary of at least 50,000 legal passwords chosen to exclude commonly
selected passwords. Upper case letters in candidate passwords should be
converted to lower case before comparison.

Table A.1 provides a rough estimate of the average entropy of user
chosen passwords as a function of password length. Estimates are given
for user selected passwords drawn from the normal keyboard alphabet that
are not subject to further rules, passwords subject to a dictionary
check to prevent the use of common words or commonly chosen passwords
and passwords subject to both composition rules and a dictionary test.
In addition an estimate is provided for passwords or PINs with a
ten-digit alphabet. The table also shows the calculated entropy of
randomly selected passwords and PINs. The values of Table A.1 should not
be taken as accurate estimates of absolute entropy, but they do provide
a rough relative estimate of the likely entropy of user chosen
passwords, and some basis for setting a standard for password strength.

The logic of the Table A.1 is as follows for user-selected passwords
drawn from the full keyboard alphabet:

-   The entropy of the first character is taken to be 4 bits;

-   The entropy of the next 7 characters are 2 bits per character; this
    is roughly consistent with Shannon’s estimate that “when statistical
    effects extending over not more than 8 letters are considered the
    entropy is roughly 2.3 bits per character;”

-   For the 9th through the 20th character the entropy is taken to be
    1.5 bits per character;

-   For characters 21 and above the entropy is taken to be 1 bit per
    character;

-   A “bonus” of 6 bits of entropy is assigned for a composition rule
    that requires both upper case and non-alphabetic characters. This
    forces the use of these characters, but in many cases these
    characters will occur only at the beginning or the end of the
    password, and it reduces the total search space somewhat, so the
    benefit is probably modest and nearly independent of the length of
    the password;

-   A bonus of up to 6 bits of entropy is added for an extensive
    dictionary check. If the Attacker knows the dictionary, he can avoid
    testing those passwords, and will in any event, be able to guess
    much of the dictionary, which will, however, be the most likely
    selected passwords in the absence of a dictionary rule. The
    assumption is that most of the guessing entropy benefits for a
    dictionary test accrue to relatively short passwords, because any
    long password that can be remembered must necessarily be a
    “pass-phrase” composed of dictionary words, so the bonus declines to
    zero at 20 characters.

For user selected PINs the assumption of Table A.1 is that such pins are
subjected at least to a rule that prevents selection of all the same
digit, or runs of digits (e.g., “1234” or “76543”). This column of Table
A.1 is at best a very crude estimate, and experience with password
crackers suggests, for example, that users will often preferentially
select simple number patterns and recent dates, for example their year
of birth.

**A.2.2 Min-Entropy Estimates**

Experience suggests that a significant share of users will choose
passwords that are very easily guessed (“password” may be the most
commonly selected password, where it is allowed). Suppose, for example,
that one user in 1,000 chooses one of the 2 most common passwords, in a
system that allows a user 3 tries before locking a password. An Attacker
with a list of user names, who knows the two most commonly chosen
passwords can use an automated attack to try those 2 passwords with each
user name, and can expect to find at least one password about half the
time by trying 700 usernames with those two passwords. Clearly this is a
practical attack if the only goal is to get access to the system, rather
than to impersonate a single selected user. This is usually too
dangerous a possibility to ignore.

We know of no accurate general way to estimate the actual min-entropy of
user chosen passwords, without examining in detail the passwords that
users actually select under the rules of the password system, however it
is reasonable to argue that testing user chosen passwords against a
sizable dictionary of otherwise commonly chosen legal passwords, and
disallowing matches, will raise the min-entropy of a password. A
dictionary test is specified here that is intended to ensure at least 10
bits of min-entropy. That test is:

-   Upper case letters in passwords are converted to entirely lower case
    and compared to a dictionary of at least 50,000 commonly selected
    otherwise legal passwords and rejected if they match any dictionary
    entry, and

-   Passwords that are detectable permutations of the username are
    not allowed.

This is estimated to ensure at least 10 bits of min-entropy. Other means
may be substituted to ensure at least 10 bits of min-entropy. User
chosen passwords of at least 15 characters are assumed to have at least
10 bits of min-entropy. For example a user might be given a short
randomly chosen string (two randomly chosen characters from a 94-bit
alphabet have about 13 bits of entropy). A password, for example, might
combine short system selected random elements, to ensure 10 bits of
min-entropy, with a longer user-chosen password.

Some password systems require a user to memorize a number of images,
such as faces. Users are then typically presented with successive fields
of several images (typically 9 at a time), each of which contains one of
the memorized images. Each selection represents approximately 3.17 bits
of entropy. If such a system used five rounds of memorized images, then
the entropy of system would be approximately 16 bits. Since this is
randomly selected password the guessing entropy and min-entropy are both
the same value.

It is possible to combine randomly chosen and user chosen elements into
a single composite password. For example a user might be given a short
randomly selected value to ensure min-entropy to use in combination with
a user chosen password string. The random component might be images or a
character string.

Agencies are, in general, issuing certificates under the policies
specified in the Common Policy Framework \[FBCA3\] to satisfy FIPS 201.
Organizations outside the US Government have begun issuing credentials
under a parallel set of policies and requirements known collectively as
PIV Interoperability specifications (PIV-I). Agencies that were early
adopters of PKI technology, and organizations outside the Federal
government, issue PKI certificates under organization specific policies
instead of the Common Policy Framework. The primary mechanism for
evaluating the assurance provided by public key certificates issued
under organization specific policies is the policy mapping of the
Federal Policy Authority to the Federal Bridge CA policies. These
policies include the Rudimentary, Basic, Medium, Medium-HW, and High
assurance policies specified in \[FBCA1\] and the Citizen and Commerce
class policy specified in \[FBCA2\].

These policies incorporate all aspects of the credential lifecycle,
often in greater detail than specified here. These policies also include
security controls (e.g., multi-party control and system auditing for
CSPs) that are outside the scope of this document. However, the FPKI
policies are based on work that largely predates this specification, and
the security requirements are not always strictly aligned with those
specified here. As a result, this appendix provides an overall mapping
between FPKI certificate policies and the e-authentication Levels
instead of a strict evaluation of compliance. There are known
discrepancies, such as FIPS 201’s allowance for pseudonyms on
credentials issued to personnel in dangerous jobs, or the ability to
issue PIV credentials based on a single federal government issued
identity credential. While these discrepancies are recognized, the
overall level of assurance provided by these policies is deemed to meet
the requirements based on the additional controls.

The table below summarizes how certificates issued under the Common
Policy Framework correspond to the e-authentication assurance levels.
Note that the Common Device policy is not listed; this policy supports
authentication of a system rather than a person. In addition, table B.1
summarizes how organization specific certificate policies correspond to
e-authentication assurance levels. At Level 2 agencies may use
certificates issued under policies that have not been mapped by the
Federal policy authority, but are determined to meet the Level 2
identify proofing, token and status reporting requirements. (For this
evaluation, a strict compliance mapping should be used, rather than the
rough mapping used for the FPKI policies.) For Levels 3 and 4, agencies
shall depend upon the mappings provided by the Federal PKI.

The Federal PKI has also added two policies, Medium Commercial Best
Practices (Medium-CBP) and Medium Hardware Commercial Best Practices
(MediumHW-CBP) to support recognition of non-Federal PKIs. In terms of
e-authentication levels, the Medium CBP and MediumHW-CBP are equivalent
to Medium and Medium-HW, respectively.

Agencies are required \[OMB M-11-11\] to broadly enable PIV credentials
for user authentication to Federal information systems. PIV credentials
are PKI certificates issued under policies that typically meet level 4,
as specified in Table B.1. Most Federal employees and many Federal
contractors possess PIV credentials and agencies are expected to enable
the use of PIV credentials for authentication at levels 1 through 4.

[^27]: “Impractical” is used here in the cryptographic sense of nearly
    impossible, that is there is always a small chance of success, but
    even the Attacker with vast resources will nearly always fail. For
    off-line attacks, impractical means that the amount of work required
    to “break” the protocol is at least on the order of 2^80^
