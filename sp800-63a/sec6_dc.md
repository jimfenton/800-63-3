# 6. Requirements for Derived Credentials

CSP looks at a credential from a different CSP that it trusts, records the information, and issues its own credential and binds it to an authenticator. I'd call that identity proofing and include that in 63A.

Where the applicant already possesses recognized authentication credentials from a trusted CSP, the additional CSP may choose to identity proof the claimant by verifying possession and control of the token associated with the credentials and issue a new derived credential.  The following details the proofing requirements for the CSP issuing a derived credential.

####5.5.1. General Requirements

- Before issuing any derived credential the CSP SHALL verify the original credential status and SHALL verify that the corresponding credential is possessed and controlled by the claimant.  
- The CSP SHALL record the details of the original credential used as the basis for derived credential issuance. 
- The CSP SHALL set the expiration of the new credential to the expiration of the original credential.
- The CSP that issued the derived credential SHOULD notify the issuer of the original credential if the derived credential is revoked.

####5.5.2. IAL 2 Requirements

- The CSP MAY perform remote or in-person proofing, but SHALL support at least one proofing process. 
- The CSP SHALL check the expiration/revocation/termination status of the original credential weekly.


####5.5.3. IAL 3 Requirements
- The CSP SHALL perform in-person proofing only.
- The CSP SHALL check the expiration/revocation/termination status of the original credential daily.
- The CSP SHALL obtain and verify a copy of a biometric recorded when the original credential was issued. An example of such a biometric is the signed biometric data object, however if the biometric reference is not available from the original AAL 3 authenticator, it may be obtained elsewhere, as long as its authenticity is assured.
- Compare a fresh biometric sample obtained in person from the applicant to the reference biometric retained from the original AAL 3 authenticator and determine that they match.
- Determine that the authenticator of the original credential meets all requirements of an AAL 3 authenticator.
