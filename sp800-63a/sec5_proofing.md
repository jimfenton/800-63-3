## 5. Identity Proofing and Verification
The following sections list the requirements CSPs must follow to identity proof an individual at each identity assurance level. 

### Random Thoughts That May Become Requirements Later  

- Phone verification must not be via soft phones such as Google Voice or Skype.
- Human-in-the-loop for remote video proofing.  Perhaps if we allow at IAL3?
- CSP must determine the minimum attributes required to uniquely resolve an identity in their target population of potential users
- user can't pause session and return later. Or maybe allow a small window
- Visual match to photo id vs. combo of visual and automated match
- Subjects may remain pseudonymous at RP's at both IAL2 or 3.  pseudonymous pseudonymity
- Allow KYC in as IAL2?
- Allow mobile in as IAL2?
- Trusted referee (canadian language), vouchee (already proofed-kind of happens in places like HSIN) or notary





#### 5.1.1 General Requirements per Identity Assurance Level
For levels 2 and above:  
1. Records of registration SHALL be maintained.   
2. The CSP SHALL maintain a record of each individual whose identity has been verified and the steps taken to verify his or her identity, including any information collected from the Applicant in compliance with the sections below.  
3. The CSP SHALL have the capability to provide records of identity proofing to RPs if required<sup>[11](#note11)</sup>.  
4. The identity proofing and registration processes SHALL be performed according to applicable written policy or *practice statement* that specifies the particular steps taken to verify identities.  
5. The entire proofing transaction, including transactions that involve a 3rd party to the CSP, SHALL occur over a mutually authenticated protected session. Equivalently, the transaction SHOULD consist of time-stamped or sequenced messages and SHOULD signed by their source and SHOULD be encrypted for their recipient.  
6. Approved cryptography SHALL be used.    
7. The CSP SHALL be able to uniquely identify each Subscriber and any associated authenticators that may have been issued to that Subscriber.  
7. Personally identifiable information (PII) collected as part of the registration process SHALL be protected, and all privacy requirements shall be satisfied.  
8. PII collect SHALL be limited to the minimum data necessary to validate the existance of the claimed identity and associate it the claimed identity to the person providing identity evidence.  
8. The results of the identity proofing step (which may include background investigations of the Applicant) SHALL be protected to ensure source authentication, confidentiality, and integrity.  
9. Agencies MAY obtain additional confidence using additional risk mitigation measures so long as additional mitigation approaches do not substitute for the guidelines herein.
10. Agencies MAY consider partitioning the functionality of an e-authentication enabled application to allow functions requiring less stringent identification of the subscriber to be available at a lower identity assurance level, while other functions are available only at a higher identity assurance level.  
11. Knowledge based proofing (KBP) (sometimes referred to as knowledge-based authentication (KBA)) verifies the identity by testing the personal knowledge of the individual against information obtained from public databases. KBP SHALL NOT be used to verify the identity of a claimant.

>**For Assertion Chapter** The CSP shall be capable of conveying this information to Verifiers. At Level 1,
the name associated with the Subscriber is provided by the Applicant and
accepted without verification. At Level 2, the identifier associated
with the Subscriber may be pseudonymous but the RA or CSP shall retain
the actual identity of the Subscriber. In addition, pseudonymous Level 2
credentials shall be distinguishable from Level 2 credentials that
contain verified names.
At Level 3 and above, the name associated with the Subscriber shall be
verified. 

> **Do we want a process section ala GPG45**  At Level 2 and higher, the Applicant supplies his or her full legal name, an address of record, and date of birth, and may, subject to the policy of the RA or CSP, also supply other PII. Detailed level-by-level identity proofing requirements are stated in Table 3.

###5.1.3 Verification Requirements
In some contexts, once an agency has met the minimum registration
requirements for an assurance level, the agency may choose to use
additional knowledge based authentication methods to increase confidence
in the registration process. For example, an Applicant could be asked to
supply non-public information on his or her past dealing with the agency
that could help confirm the Applicantâ€™s identity.
###5.1.5. Requirements for Derived Credentials
CSP looks at a credential from a different CSP that it trusts, records the information, and issues its own credential and binds it to an authenticator. I'd call that identity proofing and include that in 63A.
Where the Applicant already possesses recognized authentication credentials a trusted CSP, the additional CSP may choose to identity proof the Claimant by verifying possession and control of the token associated with the credentials and issue a new derived credential.  The following details the proofing requirements for the CSP issuing a derived credential.1.  Before issuing any derived credential the CSP **shall** verify the original credential status and shall verify that the corresponding token is possessed and controlled by the Claimant.  
2. The CSP **shall** record the details of the original credential used as the basis for derived credential issuance. 
3. Issuance may be in person or remote. 

> 
**FOR JIM?**
The new CSP **shall** set the expiration of the new credential to the expiration of the original credential.
In situations where the authenticator does not support an automated expiration date, the status of the original credential **shall** be re-checked:
- At IAL1
- At IAL2
- At IAL3
at a later date (e.g. after a week) to confirm that it was not compromised at the time of issuance of the derived credential. (This guards against the case where an Attacker requests the desired credential before revocation information can be updated.) 
If the derived credential is revoked, the CSP that issued the derived credential may notify the issuer of the original credential, if the reason for revocation might motivate action by the issuer of the original credential and applicable law, regulation, and agreements permit such notification.
