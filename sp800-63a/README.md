# SP 800-63A

This is a working draft of NIST Special Publication 800-63A *Enrollment and Identity Proofing*. This document is a sub-document referenced by [SP 800-63-3](../sp800-63-3/README.md) covering the associated topics that had been previously in SP 800-63-2.

SP 800-63A deals with the processes by which a credential, and authenticator(s) associated with that credential can be bound to a specific individual. This typically happens when that individual is enrolled in an identity system, through the identity proofing process.
