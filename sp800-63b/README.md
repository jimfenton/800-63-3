# SP 800-63B

This is a working draft of NIST Special Publication 800-63B *Subscriber Authentication*. This document is a sub-document referenced by [SP 800-63-3](../sp800-63-3/README.md) covering the associated topics that had been previously in SP 800-63-2.

SP 800-63B deals with the use of authenticators (formerly called *tokens*) to remotely authenticate a subscriber to an identity system. The outputs of a successful authentication are:

- An identifier that can be used to associate the subscriber with previous interactions with the same relying party

- A metric describing the strength of the authentication process

- Optionally, one or more attributes associated with the subscriber
