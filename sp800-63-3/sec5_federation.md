##5. Federated Identity

Strawman/Brainstorm of what this section could include:

* 800-63-3 does not presuppose a federated architecture - it is agnostic, and allows agencies to deploy their requirements as a singleton instance.  
* Federation Overview (to potential include subsuming some of the graphics in -C)
* However there are significant benefits with regards to federated architectures:
	*  User Experience (less proofing/credential of choice)
	*  Cost reduction
	*  Data minimization
	*  Privacy Enhancement
	*  Alignment to NSTIC
	*  Bring your own authenticator
	*  Pseudonymous Assertions with MFA
	*  Mission enablement - agencies should not be in business of identity management: focus on core management and let identity be a shared service they consume from a federated provider
	*  
*  Language around pseudonymous transactions.
	* Agencies shouldn't decide to roll their own just because they need a validated attribute
	* Claims based (need a better word?) don't expose entire attribute.  e.g. over 21 rather than birthdate
*  Assertions and relationship to -C
*  Componentization
*  Alignment to FICAM TFS (thinking no, but placeholder for now)
*  User consent to sharing attributes
*  Profiles, such as FICAM SAML and iGov
